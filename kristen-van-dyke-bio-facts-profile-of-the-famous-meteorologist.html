career.&nbsp;She was the host of the New Mexico Style program, which featured various local specialties and interesting lifestyle news, which she presented for KASA Fox 2 and KRQE News 13.</span></p><p><span>The program was both a starting point and a stepping stone for her when Kristen was later promoted to morning and noon weather forecaster for the two stations.&nbsp;Kristen

extraordinaire was previously diagnosed with melanoma (a highly malignant skin tumor).&nbsp;She was able to treat and overcome it because of the early diagnosis.</span></p><p><span>When she’s not
