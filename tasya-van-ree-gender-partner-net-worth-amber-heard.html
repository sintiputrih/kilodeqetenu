And now, that the Depp v. Heard trial is at its peak, Tasya is speaking in her ex-girlfriend’s defense stating that the “incident was misinterpreted and over-sensationalized by two individuals in a powerful position.”</span></p><p><span>So, did this event get you intrigued by Tasya Van Ree? Well, get to know all about her gender, partner, and net worth as this article proceeds.</span></p><h3><b>What Is Tasya Van Ree Gender?</b></h3><p><span>Tasya Van Ree is a female.</span></p><p><span>However, her gender doesn’t define who she is. “I am a cowboy, at heart. I really am… Part alien, part cowboy, part male, part female,” she explained.</span></p><p><span>Also, she believes that people become what they wear, and their personality aligns with what they look like from the outside.</span></p><h3><b>Tasya Van Ree And Amber Heard’s Relationship</b></h3><p><span>Tasya and Amber Heard first met in 2007 and quickly fell in love with each other. “There was something about her that I couldn’t quite understand. It was beyond her physical beauty, she captured something inside of me artistically. We instantaneously formed a connection,” Tasya recalled.</span></p><p><span>Soon the couple was then making headlines as power couples who influenced each other. Some even compared their relationship to Marilyn Monroe and Milton Greene, one of sensual reciprocity between artist and muse.</span></p><p><span>At the time, Tasya described Amber as a “magical entity” who kept her inspired.</span></p><p><span>Later, the two even collaborated on a book Tasya described as a “cinematic tale of one woman and her life in private, public and everything in between.”</span></p><p><span>Fast-forward to 2 years of dating, in 2009, Tasya and Amber again made the news, but this time, it was for a different reason. Reportedly, the Port of Seattle Police arrested Amber after she allegedly struck Ree at the Seattle-Tacoma International airport. The next day after, their case was assigned to King County District Court in Seattle. However, the prosecutor declined to press charges against Amber.</span></p><p><span>Speaking about the incident, Tasya later shared that Amber was wrongfully accused and the incident was misinterpreted and over-sensationalized by two individuals in a power position. Also, she added that she felt hints of misogynistic attitudes toward them which later appeared to be homophobic when they found out we were domestic partners and not just friends.</span></p><p><span>Sadly, Tasya and Amber broke up in 2012.

Eventually, she picked up photography and held her own exhibitions.</span></p><p><span>This talented photographer defines her works not just as pretty faces posed in cool places, but as something raw, sexy, and gives you pause. “It’s really just a combination of raw imagination and uninhibited technique. Taking those two elements and turning it into what I interpret as beauty. I see it as photojournalism infiltrating fashion and finding a home in the fine art world,” she explained.</span></p><p><span>Her main sources of inspiration were Henri Cartier-Bresson and Weegee.</span></p><p><span>According to </span><i><span>Huffpost</span></i><span>, if Ellen von Unwerth and Helmut Newton had a love child the result could be the photographer Tasya Van Ree.</span></p><p><span>The last we checked, her most recent exhibition was titled “Theory of Daydreams” – which featured colored photographs of butterflies.</span></p><p><span>Find her works on IG @</span><a href=#><span>tasyavanreegallery</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Besides photography, Tasya also was involved in the clothing business.
