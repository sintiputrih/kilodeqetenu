A giant mural of the <i>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</i> beauty's Internet-breaking nude selfie has been painted on the side of a digital printing shop in Melbourne, Australia, and it didn't take long before a vandal decided to deface it with brown and white paint, along with the word "slut."</p><p>"It was vandalized only just eight hours after completion," street artist Lush Sux, whose legal name is Mark Walls, tells <i>Us Weekly.</i></p><p>Walls also told BuzzFeed that he’s "bummed that people didn’t get more of a chance to interact with it and that someone felt the dire need to spray 'SLUT' across it."</p><p>The artist originally took to social media on Sunday, March 13, to share a photo of <a href=#>the masterpiece</a> he created in the image of the 35-year-old reality star's controversial skin-baring snapshot.</p><p><a href=#>@kimkardashian</a></p><p>A post shared by lushsux (@lushsux) on Mar 12, 2016 at 1:49am PST</p><p><span>He tells </span><i>Us</i><span> that he painted the mural on the 12th in Cremorne, a suburb of Melbourne. "I instantly felt the need to paint it 30 feet high," he explains. "Perhaps I'm a little bit of an attention seeker, much like Kim."</span></p><p>"It's just another painting in a long line of paintings I have completed that seem to get people all frazzled," he added.&nbsp;</p><p><span>As </span><i>Us</i><span>&nbsp;</span><a href=#>previously reported</a><span>, Kardashian posted a completely bare — save for two black bars covering her privates — mirror selfie on March 7. A divisive argument ensued among celebrities who criticized her racy ‘gram and those who supported it.</span></p><span class=caption></span><p>After stars such as <b>Chloë Grace Moretz </b>and <b>Pink</b> expressed their disapproval of the mom-of-two’s NSFW photo, she fired back by writing an essay promoting body positivity.</p><p>“I am empowered by my body. I am empowered by my sexuality. I am empowered by feeling comfortable in my skin. I am empowered by showing the world my flaws and not being afraid of what anyone is going to say about me,” <a href=#>Kardashian shared</a> on her website. “And I hope that through this platform I have been given, I can encourage the same empowerment for girls and women all over the world.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakoZ1iuKK%2Bw5qqoaGRo8BuusCknJ1lo5q5p7XEZqCsZZ6kxG6tjKasq5mcYravecCuqq2qkaG2onnWam1wa2VufA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ariana-greenblatt-html.html><span>←</span><span>Ariana Greenblatt - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
