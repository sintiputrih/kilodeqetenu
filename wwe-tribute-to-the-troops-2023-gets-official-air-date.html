It seems that one tradition will not change.</p><p>Tribute to the Troops is coming back this year, and fans will get a chance to see it on FOX. This will likely mark the last Tribute to the Troops special on FOX, since SmackDown is leaving the network in October 2024.</p><p>WWE sent out a press release today to confirm that Tribute to the Troops is scheduled to air on FOX on Friday, December 8 at 8 p.m. ET. The event will be hosted at Amica Mutual Pavilion in Providence, Rhode Island. Tickets can be purchased through Ticketmaster.com.</p><p>WWE’s Tribute to the Troops, now in its 21st year, has been a consistent tradition since its inception in 2003. The annual show is a heartfelt recognition of the dedication and sacrifices made by U.S. service members, veterans, and their families. It has earned a reputation as one of television’s most patriotic and emotionally moving programs.</p><p>WWE has a long-standing commitment to the U.S. Armed Forces, encompassing various initiatives and outreach efforts. These include visits to nearly 400 military installations across the globe, providing complimentary tickets to WWE live events for all U.S. military personnel, and collaborating with organizations like Hire Heroes USA. WWE’s support extends to the USO, and they share stories of bravery and valor through their partnership with the National Medal of Honor Museum, aiming to make a positive impact in the community.</p><p>We will have to see what WWE brings to the Tribute to the Troops special this year. That is usually a fun show, but major storylines are usually put on the back burner for a fun program of pro wrestling for the troops.</p><p>What’s your take on the Tribute to the Troops special?
