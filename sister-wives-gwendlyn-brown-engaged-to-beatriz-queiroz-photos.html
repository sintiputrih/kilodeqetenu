Pride, noting, “The spontaneity.” On day three, they made it to Disneyland, where the reality personality noted, “Feet were already aching after Pride, but it was so worth it.”</p><p>Gwendlyn hinted at coming out in a May 2021 <a href=# rel=noopener aria-describedby=audioeye_new_window_message>Twitter</a>&nbsp;post, writing,&nbsp;“As a kid, I would always argue, ‘If I’m old enough to know I’m straight, then they’re old enough to know they’re gay,’ but I was apparently not old enough to know I’m queer until 17. So, joke’s on me.”</p><p>Kody and Christine <a href=#>share a total of six children</a> with Gwendlyn being their fourth child. Her older siblings include Aspyn, Mykelti and Paedon, along with younger sisters Ysabel and Truely. The former couple <a href=#>spiritually wed</a> on March 25, 1994, and were together for 27 years before Christine announced in November 2021 that their marriage was over.

While TLC has yet to confirm a new season of Sister Wives, Christine shared a November 15 Instagram selfie while smiling inside her living room. In the caption she wrote, “</span><span class="_aacl _aaco _aacu _aacx _aad7 _aade">I’m finally filming in my house in Salt Lake!!
