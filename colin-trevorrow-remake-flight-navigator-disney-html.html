Disney has tapped Trevorrow and his Safety Not Guaranteed collaborator, Derek Connolly, to write a script for a Flight of the Navigator remake. Trevorrow may also direct the film.</p><p>A <a href=#>few weeks ago</a>, Trevorrow had to clarify that he was not up for the Star Wars directing job but teased, “his next project will involve him tackling a mythology with a substantial fan base.” It turns out that substantial fan base was for Flight of the Navigator. Derek Connolly&nbsp;told Variety, “Flight of the Navigator wasn’t a seminal movie of my childhood but I remember liking it and the original meant a lot to Colin as a kid, so it’s really his baby. It’ll be good to have some balance so it’s not two fanboys writing the movie.”</p><p>The original Flight of the Navigator took place in 1978 and was about a 12-year-old boy named David (Joey Cramer), who is knocked unconscious and wakes up in 1986. Everything in the world around him aged eight years, even his parents and his little brother Jeff, who is now 16 years old, but David hasn’t aged a day. He later discovers out that an alien craft nicknamed Max (voiced by Paul Reubens) was responsible for his journey through time, and together the two try to find a way to return David to his native era.</p><p>The original film had groundbreaking special effects and advanced 3D animation in movies in 1986. It’s also cherished by many children of the ’80s, so the remake will definitely result in some angry fanboys if they don’t get it right.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2irk56zqnvCqKOipl2pv6bCzqupqK9dp7KurcqeZJ%2BkmZy1tXnNmq2in5GpvLN5w6Kqp52pY7W1ucs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bradley-coopers-family-mom-gloria-daughter-lea-and-more.html><span>←</span><span>Bradley Cooper's Family: Mom Gloria, Daughter Lea and More</span></a>
