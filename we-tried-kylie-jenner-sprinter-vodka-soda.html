However, every once in a while, a celeb or influencer will begin a business venture that feels so on-brand that it's hard to believe they didn't do it sooner.</p><p>That's how we feel about <a href=#>Kylie Jenner</a>'s newest release, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sprinter vodka sodas</a>. Who better to tell us what to drink this summer than a young, A-list Hollywood socialite who probably throws and attends the most iconic gatherings imaginable?</p><p>Distractify tried all four flavors of the 100-calorie, 4.5% ABV canned vodka sodas — grapefruit, lime, peach, and black cherry — and we're here to let you know that you won't even think of bringing anything else to your next pool party.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Sprinter</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Kylie Jenner's Sprinter vodka sodas are your chic new summer party staple.</h2><p>When you crack open a vodka soda, you pretty much know what to expect. Light, fruity taste, carbonation, and, of course, some vodka. However, Sprinter pleasantly surprised me with a unique experience, even at first glance. As is to be expected from a fashion and lifestyle icon like the Kylie Jenner, the packaging is trendy, clean, and definitely draws your eye with its bold colors and font (I'm a sucker for good packaging).</p><p>And once I actually tasted the first drink, the pleasant surprise continued. I started with grapefruit, and it was so refreshing that I almost forgot I was drinking alcohol. The carbonation is milder than most vodka sodas I've tried, which I found that I quite enjoyed — it felt like a beverage that I could see myself easily sipping on while laying out by a resort pool, shaded by a striped umbrella and surrounded by attractive, young people playing pickleball nearby.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by SPRINTER (@drinksprinter)</a></p></figure><p>Even Kylie herself drinks them: "Not only does Sprinter have a unique bold branding that captures the feeling of fun with your friends, it is also the best tasting vodka soda I’ve ever tried — and I’ve tried a lot. I can’t wait for people to taste it for themselves," Kylie shared.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Sprinter is made with real fruit juice, and you can definitely tell.</h2><p>While the black cherry flavor ended up being my favorite, not one of the four flavors was a dud. The grapefruit and lime were mild, crisp, and refreshing, and the peach was a close second in my ranking. Each had a hint of fruity sweetness without tasting artificial, which is something that I feel not many canned cocktail brands get right.</p><p>In a market of established heavy hitters, I didn't expect a new product to pleasantly surprise me in the way that Sprinter did. However, when an occasion arises — like, say, a house party, a yacht party, or any kind of party — I know what I'll be bringing.</p><p>Sprinter is available in an 8-can variety pack for $19.99, and you can find it at major retailers nationwide like <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">Total Wine & More</a>, <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">BevMo</a>, and more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLJuwNGinJ1lm665qrGMo5ynppWnerS80aKlrZ2iYsOwsMqaZKynlJY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gage-gomez.html><span>←</span><span>Gage Gomez</span></a>
