Three weeks earlier than expected — on May 7, 2013 — Parks, a lawyer and mom to 3-year-old son Ayden, got the surprise of her life when she went into labor during a work trip to Augusta, Ga. — 150 miles from home! "I hadn't packed anything or even made arrangements for Ayden," the Secrets of the Southern Belle author, 40, admits to <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a>. "And I'm usually an Eagle Scout when it comes to being prepared!"</p><p>Eight hours later, on May 8 after an emergency C-section, <a href=#>Parks welcomed 7 pound, 9 ounce Dylan</a> into the world with fitness trainer husband <strong>Apollo Nida</strong>, 34, by her side.</p><p>Waiting to officially name their infant in a traditional African naming ceremony, Parks tells <strong>Us</strong> the little one is being well taken care of at home by big brother Ayden. "Ayden pretends to ride his bike to the store for diapers and calls him 'my baby!'" Parks gushes. (Ahead of the naming ceremony, Parks jokes to <strong>Us</strong> that the family call Dylan "Mr. President.")</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Parks herself is also soaking up as much time as she can with her new addition. "Right now, we're just enjoying every moment," she says, "because once the baby grows up, I can't put him in a time machine!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGapoJGasbOtjKmYq6OjYrqmsdNmpLJlkpavunnBqLBmnKmhrq95kWlobGloZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-was-gretta-vedler-cause-of-death-russian-model-found-dead-in-suit-case-who-killed-her-suspect-killer-name.html><span>←</span><span>What Was Gretta Vedler Cause Of Death?
