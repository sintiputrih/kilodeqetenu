Marjorie came in late, which caught Steve's attention, and he wasn't afraid to let her know from the get go that she was the one. "The very first thing I said to Marjorie was, 'I don't know who you are, but I'm going to marry you one day.' That was the beginning," the comedian recalled.</p><p>As for what Marjorie made of it all, she admitted during an ad break on&nbsp;<a href=#>"Steve"</a> in 2018 of that fateful day they met, "I thought he was gonna give me the business because he got real quiet. He was just staring at me."&nbsp;She added,&nbsp;"I thought I was gonna become part of the show. He finally realized he's gotta say something, he was like, 'Oh, I'm sorry. I don't know who this is, but I'm gonna marry her.'" Steve then admitted that he was so taken by Marjorie the first time he saw her that he stopped breathing for a second. Adorable!</p><p>Steve dished a little more on that first meeting during another <a href=#>"Steve"</a> ad break, telling the audience, "I ain't never seen nobody that looked like that. To me." He shared that they dated for two years after that, while he was actually homeless, but they sadly broke up and lost touch.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcmpnaH95e9OhnGasoqqybr%2FTqKmyZZ%2Bbeqm71maqrZ2mmnqiusNmpJqqmqS%2FqrGMoZirrpWueq6x02g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nadiuska-net-worth-71041.html><span>←</span><span>Nadiuska Net Worth</span></a>
