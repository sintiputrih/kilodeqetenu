And USA Network’s <a href=#>The Big D</a> has a pretty wide filming-to-premiere gap.</p><p>With The Ultimatum: Queer Love under scrutiny for debuting on Netflix in May 2023 after filming in 2021, viewers often wonder what other reality shows have followed a similar timeline. Because when it comes to The Big D, it turns out, the USA reality show was literally <a href=#>years in the making</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: USA</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">When was ‘The Big D’ filmed?</h2><p>The Big D’s journey to air was anything but easy.</p><p>In March 2021, WarnerMedia greenlit the <a href=#>JoJo Fletcher and Jordan Rogers</a>-hosted dating competition and began production that same month, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a>. The series was slated to debut on TBS on July 7, 2022, more than one year after filming began.</p><p>“After a year full of challenges, the opportunity to join forces with TBS and help people find love was a no-brainer,” JoJo and Jordan revealed in a statement at the time.</p><p>“We’re excited to go on this adventure in paradise with romantic hopefuls as they step out of their comfort zones and face unconventional dating scenarios in hopes of finding new love.”</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Unfortunately, The Big D never made it to TBS, with the network canceling the reality dating competition mere weeks before its premiere. The decision to cut The Big D arrived around the time Warner Bros. Discovery dealt with the fallout of the April 2022 merger.</p><p>Luckily for JoJo, Jordan, and the cast of 10 divorced couples, another network picked up the show and gave it a chance to see the light of day in 2023.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a> first reported in November 2022 that USA saved the 10-part series; however, it wasn’t until much later when The Big D finally aired.</p><p>Despite being filmed around March 2021, The Big D didn’t premiere on USA Network until Wednesday, June 14, 2023 — over two years later!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where was ‘The Big D’ filmed?</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by JoJo Fletcher (@joelle_fletcher)</a></p></figure><p>Although filming of The Big D wrapped in 2021, it occurred at an idyllic vacation destination none of the couples could forget. The USA reality romance competition occured at a Costa Rican luxury villa in Tamarindo. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Go Visit Costa Rica</a>, “Tamarindo is best known as a great beach and party spot,” which is incredibly fitting for a reality series airing alongside USA’s steamy, sun-soaked Temptation Island.</p><p>Even though the 10 divorced couples were the ones enjoying everything the island had to offer during filming, The Big D hosts couldn’t help but flex how much fun they had as well.</p><p>On Instagram in March 2021, host JoJo posted two boomerang videos of her and her now-husband Jordan after filming concluded in Tamarindo. “That’s a WRAP on filming!” <a href=#>The Bachelorette</a> alum <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> in her caption. “We will miss you Costa Ricaaaaa!”</p><p>The Big D airs Wednesdays at 10 p.m. EST on USA Network.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmuoywmKxlpJ2ybq7IoGSdZZaeua6xww%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dustin-keller-net-worth-140926.html><span>←</span><span>Dustin Keller Net Worth</span></a>
