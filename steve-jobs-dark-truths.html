Steve Jobs Was Against Giving Money To Charity</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-64570 alt=Steve_Jobs_and_Bill_Gates width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Steve_Jobs_and_Bill_Gates.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-64570 class=wp-caption-text>Comparatively, Bill Gates has donated $28 billion to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which provides aid to developing countries. Image Source: Flickr</p><p>At one point in his life, Steve Jobs spent some time thinking philanthropically. After leaving Apple in 1986, he started the Steven P. Jobs Foundation, which closed just over a year later. Returning to Apple in 1997, Jobs immediately shuttered the company’s philanthropic programs and never reinstated them, despite the company’s massive profits.</p><p>Mark Vermillion, who ran Jobs’ short lived foundation, said in <a href=#>an interview</a>, “He clearly didn’t have the time [for philanthropic endeavors]…I don’t know if it was my inability to get him excited about it…I can’t criticize Steve.” Others, who spoke anonymously to the <a href=#>New York Times</a>, indicated that as his wealth ballooned and health declined, Jobs did more good focusing his energy on expanding Apple as a company than he could by switching his focus to charity.</p><p>Still, with few exceptions, most American billionaires have given back to their communities in some way. When you consider Jobs’ $7 billion net worth, it’s astonishing that he has <a href=#>no public record</a> of ever giving to charity.</p><h2>2. Apple Employees Experience A Culture Of Fear</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-64581 alt="Steve Jobs Apple Store" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/steve-jobs-apple-store.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-64581 class=wp-caption-text>World Loyalty Team members would enter Apple stores regularly to check for potential employee leakers. Image Source: Wikimedia Commons</p><p>Under Jobs’ tenure, Apple launched a taskforce called the Worldwide Loyalty Team, which some employees have referred to as “the Apple Gestapo.” A group of moles tasked with spying in Apple headquarters and stores, the Worldwide Loyalty Team reports its findings directly to the company’s top executives.</p><p>In a <a href=#>Gizmodo interview</a>, one Apple employee recounted the following about the task force: “Management is not aware of them. Once [Apple] suspects a leak, the special forces—as we call them—will walk in the office at any hour, especially in the mornings. They will contact whoever was the most senior manager in the building, and ask them to coordinate the operation.” From there, the team proceeds to confiscate phones to look for signs of leaking activity, as management coordinates the search.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony0wMSvnGain5fAbrDAq6JmrKKqwam%2F</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tommy-paul-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Tommy Paul Net Worth: What Is Tommy Pauls Net Worth?</span></a>
