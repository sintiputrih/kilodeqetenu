In order to keep up with the limited calorie diet, the actress would typically skip dinner and limited her food intake.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I can't sleep when I'm hungry, so I would have a glass of wine to basically pass the f--k out," Shailene told the outlet. "For the last two weeks I had a can of salmon, some steamed broccoli and two egg yolks every day," adding, "It was f--king miserable."&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately, Shailene was not having to undergo this transformation alone. "I don't know that I could do it without Sam," she said. "We both really were there for one another in our moments of extreme exhaustion and hunger." &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Shailene added, "We were working extremely long hours out on the open sea. Sam and I were losing quite a bit of weight as we weren't eating much. ...So not having the fuel to run you physically, along with the emotional complexities that were incredibly taxing at times, mixed with the physicality, it could have been a grueling experience."&nbsp;</p><p>And, hunger pains were not the only thing the cast had to deal with. Shailene revealed that both she and her on-screen partner got seasick while filming.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Shailene Woodley reveals she was seasick while filming 'Adrift.'</h2><p>Getting seasick is not uncommon, but having to go through feeling nausea all-day for months on end is probably dreadful. "It’s so graphic. But I couldn’t quite get my body to throw up. When you’re seasick and finally able to throw up, you kind of get your footing again," she revealed (via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">USA Today</a>). "I wasn’t able to do that. It was just an all-day nausea and quite miserable."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"Pretty much everybody&nbsp;threw up at least once," Sam added. Shailene noted that the anxious look on the actors' faces about the incoming hurricane are really the co-stars trying not to get sick on camera.&nbsp;</p><p>"What the audience sees in that scene is a&nbsp;look of nervousness,” she explained.&nbsp;“But it’s really Sam and I trying not puke when the cameras are rolling. It’s like, 'Keep it together.' That's pure anxiety.”&nbsp;</p><p>Watch Adrift on Netflix now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLWitcuepZ5lp6S8pbjEsmSanKKes7V51p6goKCkYrmwv9I%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./whitney-houston-robyn-crawford-relationship-true-story.html><span>←</span><span>Whitney Houston &amp;amp; Robyn Crawford's Real-Life Relationship Was Very Intimate</span></a>
