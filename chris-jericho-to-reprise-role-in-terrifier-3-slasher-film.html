He has several conquests in other fields as well since he’s also the vocalist of the <a href=#>long-standing heavy metal band Fozzy</a>. Now, after starring in the TV movie Country Hearts as well as appearing in a cameo in Terrfier 2, Jericho will be starring in a larger capacity in the upcoming film of the slasher franchise.</p><p>In a recent interview with <a href=#>Deadline</a>, director Damien Leone spoke about his upcoming film, Terrifier 3. At one point, he revealed that Jericho would be making a larger appearance in Terrifier 3 and teased some new characters as well. He also stated that the third film is going to pick up right where the second part ended.</p><p>There are a few new major characters introduced in three, one in particular that it’s too soon for me to announce…What I think I can say at this stage is that Chris Jericho is going to be returning. He’s super excited. This one is going to pick up where Part 2 left off, in the insane asylum, so, you’re going to see what transpires there, what mayhem unfolds, because seeing how Art and Victoria ended up, is so insane, and seeing how they get out of that situation and what happens next is going to be really wild. So, we have to get Chris back in there and see how he becomes a part of that situation.</p><p>It should be noted that Jericho was featured as a psychiatric attendant at the end of Terrifier 2. While most people considered it to be a mere cameo, it turns out that Leone had a much bigger role for the AEW superstar in mind.</p><p>Jericho has discussed the artistic direction of the franchise with Leone before. He particularly spoke about the prime antagonist, Art the Clown, with the director on an episode of Talk Is Jericho last year. Terrifier 3 is currently scheduled to release on October 25, 2024.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Chris Jericho is currently enjoying his tenure at AEW.
