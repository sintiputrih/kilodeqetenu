He had to stay put at the crease, but that enabled him to have a steady head, watch the ball closely and let his hand-eye coordination do the work, backed by exceptional bat speed.</p><p>"Different formats of the game and stages of the game require different footwork. And sometimes, no footwork becomes great footwork too," he added.</p><p>Maxwell was making his return to the playing XI after missing out on the clash with England, as he suffered bruises and concussions after falling off a golf cart.</p><p>Nonetheless, he continued his imperious form, emerging as the side's second-highest run scorer in this competition.</p><p>Maxwell, who had recorded the fastest hundred in World cup history during their match against the Netherlands, has so far scored 397 runs in seven meetings at an average of 79.40 and a strike rate of 152.69.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sLrMmqWoqpGirm%2BvzqZmrKifp8G0e8KroJyjlal8c3yRbGZqaV9lhXC%2FzqacraGdmsBuus5mnainpKy8s7eMm5ycp52awG6z0Z6YrWiWpLy1w86romaslaOxtrjKmqlmmZKkwrV5zJqvsJ2coXqjuMinm56qXp3Brrg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lisa-marie-tasker.html><span>←</span><span>Lisa Marie Tasker - Bio, Age, Married, Net Worth, Career, Facts</span></a>
