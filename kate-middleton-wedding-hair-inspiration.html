Scroll through the gallery for more inspiration…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e5257a4e962f-2-kate-middleton-hair-updo-malaysia-a.jpg><p id=e1yLLvf962M5>This chic twisted updo, worn by Kate during a royal tour of Malaysia in 2012, is perfect for brides. The Duchess’ hair was smoothed back into a low chignon, but the twisted strands and beaded hair grips add an extra-special touch.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b4b24a6a7fbe-3-kate-middleton-braided-updo-a.jpg><p id=eIJdcYn4ugtZ>She may have worn this for an engagement on St Patrick’s Day, but we think this braided bun would make a beautiful wedding updo.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f993003a1367-4-kate-middleton-braided-chignon-a.jpg><p id=ep4m_yjOZrDn>The Duchess of Cambridge’s hair was styled into yet another chic updo as she attended the annual Remembrance Sunday service in 2018. The knotted French braid will take some effort to perfect, but it’s well worth the effort!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8f27216becdd-5-kate-middleton-hair-down-waves-a.jpg><p id=eWKcyoGh3Jr0>If you’ve got gorgeous long hair like Kate, why not forgo an updo in favour of a bouncy blow dry? Relaxed, yet styled to perfection, moving your parting to one side and having a rich, glossy colour like Kate makes this a failsafe look.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d4573ef89abb-6-kate-middleton-half-up-half-down-a.jpg><p id=eQZxT3AUNLBQ>Kate often wears her hair in a half-up, half-down style, but with subtle changes such as backcombing at the crown or twisting the hair at the back. Add a bridal hair clip and a veil, and this look would be ideal for your big day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ed61568870f1-7-kate-middleton-side-swept-updo-a.jpg><p id=e_9YXOB-utNn>If it works for your gown, a side-swept updo can make a gorgeous choice for brides. If your hair isn’t as long (or as thick!) as Kate’s, adding clip-in extensions can help to give the illusion of a more&nbsp;full, twisted bun.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f7d88335b3a3-8-kate-middleton-hair-ponytail-a.jpg><p id=eq4q3PDDM1NB>Who says you can’t rock a ponytail on your big day? Best suited to the more laidback bride, adding volume at the crown and finishing off with beautiful bridal accessories will transform your ‘do from the everyday to the extraordinary.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/92d1ddc39874-9-kate-middleton-chignon-a.jpg><p id=ehA0yK289p5_>As Kate knows, you can’t go wrong with a classic chignon for timeless, elegant style. Keep some hair down at the front to frame your face and backcomb at the roots to add volume to this ultra-chic updo.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1de577c0d2b2-10-kate-middleton-hair-trooping-the-colour-2016-a.jpg><p id=e3RRzvWBc4_d>What’s not to love about this side-swept updo that the Duchess of Cambridge wore for Trooping the Colour in 2016? Ideal for brides, bridesmaids and wedding guests alike, this will suit everyone.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dbe33d4fa7ee-11-kate-middleton-updo-2010-a.jpg><p id=emuwRTj3VPNU>It’s rare to see Kate with her hair completely brushed back off her face, but this look is gorgeous. The voluminous updo is even more gorgeous from the back, with twists and braids perfectly pinned into place – you’re going to need a professional for this one.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfl7%2BqsMSsZmtoYW59cnySb21qb2JkuKLAxGakopyUobK1u81mrp6clJ67qHnHmqCrZZmjwLG10ZqroqeeZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wit-wisdom-skinny-jeans-shapewear-smoothing-stretch-comfort-reviews.html><span>←</span><span>Wit &amp;amp; Wisdom Ab-Solution Jeans Will Be Your Favorite Shapewear</span></a>
