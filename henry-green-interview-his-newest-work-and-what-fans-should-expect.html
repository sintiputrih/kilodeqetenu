It felt really special to step out at a sold out Barbican and perform that track to ears that hadn't heard it yet."</p><p>And, for fans who weren't there to experience that themselves, fear not - Henry is excited to do it again in the future, with his new music.</p><h2 id=henry-hints-at-what-he-hopes-fans-take-away-from-the-track>Henry Hints At What He Hopes Fans Take Away From The Track</h2><p>Aside from "New Fires" being nothing short of a bop, there's also a deeper meaning to it - and Henry hopes listeners will pick up on it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The track is about finding your place, at your own pace, in an overwhelming and hectic world.
