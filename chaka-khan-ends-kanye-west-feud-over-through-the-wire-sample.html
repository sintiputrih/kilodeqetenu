Khan’s drama with West, 46, stemmed over how he sampled her song, “Through the Fire,” for his debut solo single, 2003’s “Through the Wire,” a cut from his landmark album The College Dropout. Khan wasn’t happy with how West sped up her vocals for the beat, making her voice almost unrecognizable.</p><p>The practice of speeding up or slowing down loops has since become commonplace, thanks in part to West’s influence on hip-hop and the proliferation of TikTok. Khan now recognizes this, telling Rolling Stone, “Because if I understood the rap game more completely, like I do now, then that wouldn’t have been a big deal to me.”</p><p>When asked whether “Through the Wire” bothers her anymore, Khan dismissed any notion of being <a href=#>fazed</a> by West’s sample. “No, I’m done. Please,” she said. ”I’m not <a href=#>hanging</a> on to any silly grudges.”</p><p>Khan’s change came a year after the “Tell Me Something Good” singer said she was still “upset about sounding like a chipmunk.” Khan went on <a href=#>Good Day DC </a>in 2022 and said West “didn’t mention that he was going to speed it up, you know, three times its normal speed. Had he, I would’ve had something to say.”</p><p>In 2019, while on <a href=#>Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen</a>, Khan went into detail about how the collaboration came about. In 2002, West was involved in a near-fatal car accident. His jaw was wired shut, and the legend around “Through the Wire” is that he wrote and rapped the song while his jaw was held in place.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Chaka-Khan-Ends-Kanye-West-Feud-2.jpg><p>“[West] called me when he just got out of the hospital,” Khan said on the 2019 episode of WWHL. “He said, ‘You were so instrumental in my healing process. I changed the words a little bit to the song but I had to eat through a wire. Jaws wired shut through a straw. It meant that much to me.’ … I was like, ‘Yeah, use it.’ Then when it came out, I was pissed. It was a little insulting. Not insulting, I thought it was stupid. If I’d known he was going to do that, I would have said, ‘Hell no.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>As 2023 ends, however, Khan is too busy enjoying her “rich-ass life,” as she told RS, to be bothered. It’s also why she’s done with touring. “I’ve got great-grandchildren I want to get to know better,” she told the publication. “So, I will<a href=#> not do another tour</a>. I’ll do dates, but it won’t look like a tour. They’ll be far enough apart that I can have time to sleep in between.”</p><p>As for <a href=#>retiring</a> altogether? “Well, I might do that three or four times, like other bitches do,” Khan said with a laugh.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJqhmZuWeqy0wKdknqaUqHqsrc2ynGavlajBbrLErptmp6aav27Ax6umrp%2BYYsGpsYywoKudXaiurrzLnmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./baton-rouge-serial-killer-derrick-todd-lee-seven-deaths-2-murders-convicted-dna-evidence.html><span>←</span><span>Baton Rouge Serial Killer Derrick Todd Lee charmed his way into victims' homes in Louisiana before k</span></a>
