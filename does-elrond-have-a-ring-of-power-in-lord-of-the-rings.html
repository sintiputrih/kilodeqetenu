Each one has a unique backstory, powers, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wielders</a>, and very few are ever discussed in the Lord of the Rings media released thus far.</p><p data-characters=184 data-current-count=184 data-injectable=false>The multitude of questions surrounding the Rings of Power is prompting a renewed interest in a number of potential ring bearers, including Rivendell’s unshakeable leader, Elrond.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Does Elrond have a Ring of Power?</h3><p data-characters=454 data-current-count=638 data-injectable=true>Lord Elrond of Rivendell is one of the most important Elves in Tolkien’s collection of stories. He created the Fellowship of the Ring, which ultimately led to the destruction of the One Ring. Lord Elrond was instrumental in providing information to the company of Thorin Oakenshield in their quest to locate and reclaim the Lonely Mountain. He fostered Aragorn for years, educating him and helping to shape him into the man he would one day become.</p><p data-characters=388 data-current-count=388 data-injectable=false>He also wielded one of the three Rings of Power that were given to the Elves in the Second Age. The ring, initially entrusted to Ereinion Gil-galad, was bestowed upon Elrond following Sauron’s defeat in the aptly named “War of the Elves and Sauron.” Gil-galad appointed Elrond as his vice-regent and in doing so, he passed on the most powerful of the Elven Rings, Vilya.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Vilya_Lord_of_the_Rings.jpg><p data-characters=490 data-current-count=490 data-injectable=true>Vilya — also known as the “Ring of Sapphire” or the “Ring of Air” — is described as a large blue stone set into a gold band. It is, as mentioned above, generally considered to be the strongest of the three Elven Rings. For years, Elrond used the ring in subtle ways, syphoning its power into Rivendell to keep the population of the valley safe from harm. Vilya also lent greatly to Elrond’s ability to heal, saving many a life during its years in his care.</p><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=245 data-injectable=false>The power imbued in Vilya gradually faded following Sauron’s defeat and the destruction of the One Ring. When Elrond crossed the sea into the Undying Lands, he took the ancient accessory with him, permanently retiring it from Middle-earth.</p><p data-characters=69 data-current-count=314 data-injectable=false>The Rings of Power will debut on Amazon Prime Video on Sept. 2, 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJom6ido2Kyrb7Op5tmoJGrsm6tjKugp59dpLNuvM6wnKtlmaN6rbvRnWSonl2ptaZ50aKloKtf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./arielle-vandenberg-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Arielle Vandenberg Bio (Wiki)</span></a>
