In March, the reality star debuted his massive <a href=# data-link=1>weight loss</a> on social media, revealing that <a href=#>he had lost more than 100 pounds</a> during his time behind bars. During an interview with InTouch the following month, Nava claimed that his estranged wife, 24, was <a href=#>uncomfortable with his new slim figure</a>.</p><p>“I think she was just jealous of the attention that I was getting,” he said in April, confirming that he and the Russia native were “not together” at the time. “The news about my weight loss didn’t sit with her very well. … That’s when she blocked my phone calls and I kind of was starting to lose contact with her.”</p><p>Before his eventual release from prison, a rep for Nava told Us that he was <a href=#>already planning to file for divorce</a> from Arkipchenko, who made her romance with boyfriend <strong>Leo Assaf</strong> Instagram official in March. Despite the drama surrounding his relationship with his estranged wife, Nava is hopeful that he’ll be able to find love again someday in the future.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“One of the first things I had to deal with was leaving my family and leaving my relationship behind. That was hard. That was very difficult,” he said <a href=#>during an April episode of 90 Day Fiancé: Self-Quarantined</a>, reflecting on his time in prison. “Probably about two months after I was in prison, she basically told me that she couldn’t be with me anymore. … I feel like love is the least of my priority list because I just have to get my life together and make sure I’m good as a person before I’m able to give somebody else something.”</p><p><strong>Hear the Us Weekly editors break down the most surprising celebrity births during the pandemic in under 2 minutes!</strong><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGZyaF2Zrrq%2FjKOmq5%2BVYruiwsBmqqmkmanAbrLRqKRmmZ6btrStjJqppKCZpbCpsc2kpmaZlqmys3mSZrCemaKofA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chicago-fire-boss-on-casey-and-bretts-romance-gabby-more.html><span>←</span><span>'Chicago Fire' Boss on Casey and Brett's Romance, Gabby, More</span></a>
