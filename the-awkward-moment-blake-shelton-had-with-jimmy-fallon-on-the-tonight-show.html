"I loved the 15-minute segment you did making fun of my damn album cover. Can you try to help me sell albums for once?" the singer chuckled, per&nbsp;<a href=#>CMT</a>. Although there's a chance Shelton took it in stride, we can't help but wonder if there was a twinge of frustration, making the whole chat a little awkward. Fans picked up on it, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Fallon wasn't finished with Shelton, though. There was more to come as Fallon mocked what he imagined his friend's life in Oklahoma must've been like. He then dunked on the name Shelton chose for his restaurant, Ol' Red, and then put on a cowboy hat while mock-singing his then-new track, "I'll Name the Dogs." Ouch. Maybe Fallon went too far that time?&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhnZoR2fo6tn55lkay4uK3RnWSmp52au7V5waWYpJ1dqLWmuNOopWagkZl6uLXToWSjoZ2ixm6ywKWjqKZdpLtuwMeeZK2nnp60qcCMrJ%2Bor18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./if-you-wanted-wednesday-to-end-up-with-xavier-winter-spring-summer-or-fall-is-the-film-for-you.html><span>←</span><span>If you wanted Wednesday to end up with Xavier, Winter Spring Summer or Fall is the film for yo</span></a>
