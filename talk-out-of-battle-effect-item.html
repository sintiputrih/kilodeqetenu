I don't think the part about them still evolving when an evolutionary stone is used on them while holding an everstone is true. I have a Pikachu which I put an everstone on, and when I attempted to use a thunder stone, it said it was unable to use it. I think now it works with stone induced evolutions too.Pikachufan101 (talk) 22:08, 20 December 2016 (UTC) Deletion This page was originally created to encapsulate information about held items with out-of-battle effects, because they didn't have their own pages."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
