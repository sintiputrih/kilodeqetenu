Fried will speak to reporters the day before his start, which is protocol during the postseason.</p><p class=story-text data-index=8>Over the five innings, Fried allowed three runs (two earned). He threw 76 pitches. He gave up six hits, two of which were back-to-back homers to Kevin Pillar and Sean Murphy. He issued three walks, including a four-pitch walk to end his start.</p><p class=story-text data-index=9>Fried’s team of starters lost 4-1 to the “Visiting Braves” – a team made up of mostly bench players – in the seven-inning contest.</p><p class=story-text data-index=11>The reason for Fried’s “unearned” run: In simulated games, teams can work on whatever they want, and do it however they want. In this case, Fried got Luke Williams to ground out to shortstop, but the Braves had Williams stay on first to allow Fried to work out of the stretch. Williams eventually advanced to third base on Dalton Guthrie’s single and scored on Nicky Lopez’s double.</p><p class=story-text data-index=13>Fried throwing 76 pitches Tuesday seems to mean he would be lined up to start Game 2 on Monday at Truist Park, if the Braves decide to go that direction and Fried’s blister is fine. If that’s the case, Spencer Strider would start Game 1.</p><p class=story-text data-index=14>The off-days mixed into the NLDS allow the Braves to use Strider and Fried in four of five possible games, with their Game 3 pitching plans seemingly being up in the air. It’s difficult to know how Fried’s blister would fare while he pitches.</p><p class=story-text data-index=15>To begin his outing Tuesday, Fried threw two perfect innings on 23 pitches. He retired the first eight batters he faced before Guthrie’s single. Fried encountered trouble in the third, then struggled a bit in the fourth and fifth – though you perhaps shouldn’t care about his results in a simulated game.</p><p class=story-text data-index=17>In the fourth, Pillar launched one homer. Then Murphy followed with another. In the fifth inning, Fried allowed a leadoff single. Then with one out, he walked consecutive batters – one in a nine-pitch at-bat – before the Braves called the inning.</p><p class=story-text data-index=20>(Again, simulated games are controlled. On Tuesday, the Braves ended multiple innings before there were three outs so they could manage pitchers’ pitch counts.)</p><p class=story-text data-index=21>Pitching opposite Fried, AJ Smith-Shawver hurled five scoreless innings against the Braves’ everyday players, minus Marcell Ozuna, who was the starting first baseman for the visiting team. Braden Shewmake took Ozuna’s spot in the home Braves’ lineup, batting ninth.</p><p class=story-text data-index=22>Collin McHugh pitched the final two innings in relief of Fried for the home Braves. Kyle Wright threw the last two innings behind Smith-Shawver for the visiting Braves.</p><p class=story-text data-index=23><b>Lineups</b></p><p class=story-text data-index=24>The lineups were as follows …</p><p class=story-text data-index=26><b>Visiting Braves</b></p><p class=story-text data-index=27>SS Nicky Lopez</p><p class=story-text data-index=28>LF Kevin Pillar</p><p class=story-text data-index=29>C Sean Murphy</p><p class=story-text data-index=30>1B Marcell Ozuna</p><p class=story-text data-index=32>CF Forrest Wall</p><p class=story-text data-index=33>2B Vaughn Grissom</p><p class=story-text data-index=34>RF Sam Hilliard</p><p class=story-text data-index=35>3B Luke Williams</p><p class=story-text data-index=36>DH Dalton Guthrie</p><p class=story-text data-index=38>RHP AJ Smith-Shawver</p><p class=story-text data-index=39><b>Home Braves</b></p><p class=story-text data-index=40>RF Ronald Acuña Jr.</p><p class=story-text data-index=41>2B Ozzie Albies</p><p class=story-text data-index=42>3B Austin Riley</p><p class=story-text data-index=44>1B Matt Olson</p><p class=story-text data-index=45>C Travis d’Arnaud</p><p class=story-text data-index=46>CF Michael Harris II</p><p class=story-text data-index=47>LF Eddie Rosario</p><p class=story-text data-index=48>SS Orlando Arcia</p><p class=story-text data-index=50>DH Braden Shewmake</p><p class=story-text data-index=51>LHP Max Fried</p><p class=story-text data-index=52><b>Atmosphere</b></p><p class=story-text data-index=53>There was a nice turnout for this workout, as the lower bowl on the right side (around the Braves’ dugout) mostly was full.</p><p class=story-text data-index=54>The Braves, as promised, treated this like a real game. Public address announcer Kevin Kraus performed his usual routine of welcoming fans to the ballpark, reading the lineups and more. The scoreboard was on. ... And on and on.</p><p class=story-text data-index=56><b>A cool moment</b></p><p class=story-text data-index=57>For the most part, the visiting Braves were a collection of Braves bench players and Triple-A Gwinnett players.</p><p class=story-text data-index=58>There are a couple of exceptions.</p><p class=story-text data-index=59>One of them is Isaiah Drake, the 18-year-old outfielder drafted by the Braves in the fifth round in July. He played in center field late in the game. And in his lone at-bat, he smoked a triple off the wall that scored a run.</p><p class=story-text data-index=60>Pretty good for an 18-year-old.</p><p class=story-text data-index=62><b>Braves broadcasts viewership update</b></p><p class=story-text data-index=63>In a release, Bally Sports South and Bally Sports Southeast said it ended the 2023 regular season with its highest household rating since 2019. The networks also reported an increase in year-over-year viewership metrics across all platforms.</p><p class=story-text data-index=64>The networks televised 146 Braves game this season, and 108 of them ranked No. 1 across all networks in the Atlanta DMA (Designated Market Area) during their time slots. Of the remaining 38 games, 28 ranked No. 2 in the Atlanta market and 10 were No. 3 in their time slots – and included in that are three rain delays and four games after the team had clinched its sixth consecutive NL East title.</p><p class=story-text data-index=65>The networks said household ratings for 2023 Braves telecasts increased 17% year-over-year for an average of 3.44 in the Atlanta DMA, which is over 92,000 impressions. The ratings average was the second highest of the last 10 years, only trailing a 3.62 household rating in the 2019 season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orbCZ5qopV%2BovbC%2B06xmmqyclru1rYybqZqulah8o77Ar5ysZZ2WxW6y0aKcnWWknb%2Bww9JmnaKulWK2r7rIp56sZaSqsrSwwLJkoqZdqLauwcuaq56cXZyurrGMoqVmnqKku7V5zp9kn5meqHyIm6iIbn2If3anhqKUfoCBiIdohJCNpn5qhmc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lele-pons-pictures-of-the-star.html><span>←</span><span>Pictures Of The Star Hollywood Life</span></a>
