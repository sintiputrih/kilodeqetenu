WandaVision could not have <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">kicked off the streaming era of the MCU in stronger form</a>, so Kathryn Hahn’s spinoff outing as Westview’s last resident witch needs to measure up to what came before it. Thankfully, the latest rumored plot details indicate it won’t disappoint.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=377 data-current-count=377 data-injectable=false>For starters, comics readers were convinced that Agatha’s pet rabbit Senor Scratchy in WV was really her son, Nicholas Scratch, in disguise. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Cosmic Circus</a>, the bad bunny does have demonic origins but he’s not Scratch. That said, Nicholas will allegedly be introduced in Coven of Chaos himself, so fans will get to see the Harkness family expanded.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Aubrey-Plaza-The-White-Lotus.jpg><p data-characters=507 data-current-count=507 data-injectable=true>What’s more, rumors have been swirling lately that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Agatha could be portrayed as bisexual</a> in the series, something that TCC corroborates. Specifically, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Aubrey Plaza’s mystery character</a> is said to be introduced as a villain who is a former love interest of Agatha’s, a fellow witch from Salem in the 1600s. Plaza’s character is compared to Emilia Clarke’s G’iah from Secret Invasion in that she will be an original character for the screen but one with ties to the comics.</p><p data-characters=444 data-current-count=444 data-injectable=true>The most intriguing detail teased about Plaza’s role, however, is that she will “date way back to the earliest days of the cinematic universe.” That’s surprising to hear, as obviously the MCU didn’t introduce the idea of witchcraft and sorcery until Doctor Strange in 2016, but apparently Plaza’s character will link up with the franchise’s beginnings, probably meaning some kind of Phase One project.</p><p data-characters=140 data-current-count=140 data-injectable=false>All in all, Agatha: Coven of Chaos seems destined to really get the fandom engaged once it finally arrives on Disney Plus sometime in 2024.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yiuoyepKaxXaO8rrXNmquenF2irrPCxKVkp52nmLyusdFmoKdlkWKxqr%2FNnrBmqJyqwG6%2FxKqsnqRdqLKztcSsZJ%2BZk567qHnAZqOorF2ks2680Z6qrK2imnqqv4yrrKanopqxbsDOZquinV2eu7W7jK2fnmWfp7aotc2sZKieXam1pnnMnKxo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./spencer-reid.html><span>←</span><span>11 Best Spencer Reid Episodes From Criminal Minds You Can Watch If You Miss His Character</span></a>
