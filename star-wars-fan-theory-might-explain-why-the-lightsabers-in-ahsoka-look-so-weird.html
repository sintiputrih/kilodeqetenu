Several dark Force users also briefly appeared in the trailer, both wielding lightsabers of a curious color. We’ve seen the iconic weapons appear in a range of colors before, but none outside of red, blue, green, purple, and white. Those last two are also exceedingly rare, with only Mace Windu and Ahsoka known to wield a purple or white saber.</p><p data-characters=416 data-current-count=416 data-injectable=true>A new color debuted in the Ahsoka trailer, confusing fans and prompting questions about the significance of an orange lightsaber. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Both Shin Hati</a> and Baylon Skoll revealed orange sabers in brief flashes, and viewers are certain they hold some significance. One even thinks they’ve got it figured out, explaining to Reddit’s fan theories sub their belief that “Baylon and Shin use False Kyber.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>[Star Wars] Baylon and Shin use False Kyber</a><br>by <a href=#>u/MicooDA</a> in <a href=#>FanTheories</a></figure><p data-characters=483 data-current-count=783 data-injectable=true>The user explains, via a lengthy but well-written post, that — while it’s not impossible for Kyber Crystals to be orange — they believe the color is instead the result of “Kohlen Crystal.” Also known as false Kyber, these Crystals share similarities with Kyber but are vitally different on a molecular level. Considering the scarcity of Kyber Crystals around the galaxy, user MicooDA believes Shin and Baylon are using a fake alternative to power their weapons.</p><p data-characters=440 data-current-count=440 data-injectable=true>They’ve got the receipts to back their claim up and even noted their theory that Shin and Baylon aren’t Sith. Instead, they are a new sect of the Jedi Order, reimagined by Baylon in his own image. Without access to proper Kyber Crystals, they sought out the false substitute — along with a droid that could <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">teach them how to construct lightsabers</a> — and began the process of creating a new, twisted version of the Jedi Order.</p><p data-characters=360 data-current-count=360 data-injectable=false>It’s a good theory, and commenters were quick to point that out below the post. Not everyone is on board with the idea, with some noting that Kyber Crystals can change color, even after a saber has been constructed, but MicooDA is standing strong. They think their theory is the best explanation for the orange sabers, and we can’t help but agree.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y0wMCrZLCZoqh6p63NZquhnZ%2Bnxm65yKCfrWWVrb2trcinZLCgqWLBqbGMpaCgoKSorqOx0axkoqZdlrW0u8qaZKWnn6B6tLuMsJyiqpRk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ken-squier-age-wife-net-worth-children-height.html><span>←</span><span>Ken Squier Age, Wife, Net Worth, Children, Height</span></a>
