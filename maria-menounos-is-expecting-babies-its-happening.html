Once we get back, we’ll do it.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The<a href=#> Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a> star, 40, explained on the show that same month that she connected with both of her babies “instantly” when they arrived. “There was no weird feeling that I was so nervous about, [like] ‘Am I gonna feel the same way?’” the makeup mogul recalled. “It was the same exact feeling [as with <a href=#>North</a>, 7, and <a href=#>Saint</a>, 5]. That was instantly a relief for me, because that’s what I was most nervous about, and I just feel lucky that I’ve had such a good experience with surrogacy.”</p><p>The E! personality went on to call surrogacy “the best decision [she] ever made.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGammaKerm65xKemrqafqHqqv4yer6mdk6m2r7OMm5iboZWoeqrA0mafmqigmruqusZo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jay-lenos-long-term-partner-vowed-never-to-have-kids-or-get-married-heres-why-she-changed-her-mind.html><span>←</span><span>Jay Lenos Long-Term Partner Vowed Never To Have Kids Or Get Married Heres Why She Changed Her Mind</span></a>
