Still, Rick's other two sons, Adam and Jake, definitely didn't.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Adam has appeared on the show a few times, but never chose to pursue a career in pawning or reality TV. He got his start working at the pawnshop but quickly decided that his real passion was plumbing. These days Adam lives in Las Vegas, near the rest of the family, but it's unlikely you'll see him around the shop. Adam runs his own plumbing business around Las Vegas, per <a href=#>Celebrity Mirror</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>That brings us to Rick's third son, Jake. Jake is much younger than his two older brothers, so he hasn't had to make a decision about whether or not to join Rick in the family business yet. He does, however, take after his father in one important way. Jake and Rick are both hardcore Republicans. Jake and Rick were photographed attending a Trump fundraiser back in 2018, per <a href=#>Las Vegas Review Journal</a>.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>For his part, Corey and Rick are very close. Not only do they share an interest in pawning and historical objects (and appearing on reality TV), but they also co-own the business together. Furthermore, their personal lives have turned out to be quite similar. Just like dad, Corey has been married more than once and even has his own son who might just follow in the family business too, per Celebrity Mirror.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbG5mboR3e9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2ntqS3jKGYq6qZqLyvv4ykoJ2rXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jacqui-heinrich-wikipedia-age-husband-measurements.html><span>←</span><span>Jacqui Heinrich Wikipedia: Age, Husband, Measurements.</span></a>
