The actress currently headlines the Apple TV series Dickinson, a comedy that follows budding writer <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Emily Dickinson</strong></a> as she navigates the constraints of gender and society during the 19th century. The second season wrapped back in February, and it has since been renewed for a third. A release date has not been announced yet. On top of starring as the titular character, Hailee also serves as executive producer. She reflected on what <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">she learned behind the camera</a> in an interview with Collider in January. &nbsp;“I’ve always had an appreciation for how many people it takes to pull off something great,” she said. “Especially in regards to film and television, there are a lot of people involved that aren’t even on the set, and on the set, there are a lot of people.” “As a producer, I’ve realized that the amount of work that every single person has to put into something in order for it to work is quite a lot, and I’m just so grateful for that,” Hailee added. The star also has another formidable TV role on the horizon: <strong>Kate Bishop</strong> in Disney+’s upcoming miniseries Hawkeye opposite <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Jeremy Renner</strong></a>. Hailee gushed about her excitement to join the Marvel Cinematic Universe to Collider.<p>“I’m just so honored to be a part of the MCU, and more so excited to be able to talk about it,” she said.&nbsp;“It’s been quite awhile that I’ve been having to keep that a secret, and I’m not good at that. It’s been a wonderful experience, developing this character and taking elements of her from the comics and what we know with her history. It’s just very exciting to be playing a character, much like Emily, that is so loved by so many people.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH14e5FqZqGZmaGypnnSrZyippaauaV506Gmp59dl7astc2iZKmgn6m8cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./former-super-bowl-champion-matt-ulrich-dies.html><span>←</span><span>Former Super Bowl champion Matt Ulrich dies</span></a>
