We specialize in traditional BBQ, can throwdown TexMex with the best of them, and can throw on a tux if needed.‚Äù</p><p>In addition to barbecuing, 187BBQ also launched its own beer in May 2023.

On 13 May 2023, Eduardo reflected on a conversation that he and his daughter had a few years back. She was watching him Barbecue asked him ‚ÄúDaddy, you love to bbq.. why don‚Äôt you do a show like this?‚Äù</p><p>He replied: ‚ÄúBaby, you‚Äôll see Daddy on TV one day.‚Äù</p><p>Eduardo writes, ‚ÄúThe odds were stacked against me and I knew that I might be making a false promise to the one little girl who means the MOST to me in this world. It broke my heart feeling like I was lying to my little girl who looks up to me as her superhero. In her mind at that very moment, she was certain that she would see her daddy on tv. WE MANIFESTED THIS BABY GIRL. We worked hard, we put in the work, we put in the hours.. WE DID THIS. All the blood, sweat, and tears are worth it. On May 26 my daughter will be able to walk around with her head up high telling the world, ‚ÄúMy daddy is on Netflix.‚Äù I fulfilled that promise. We did this baby girl. I did this for you ‚ù§Ô∏è.‚Äù</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Eduardo Gonzalez Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Eduardo Gonzalez celebrates his birthday in July.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Is Eduardo Gonzalez On Instagram?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Of course, he is.
