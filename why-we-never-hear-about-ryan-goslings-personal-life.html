We'll dig a little deeper and find out why.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ryan-gosling-and-eva-mendes-have-more-of-an-appreciation-for-the-simple-lifestyle>Ryan Gosling And Eva Mendes Have More Of An Appreciation For The Simple Lifestyle</h2><p>He's one of the more famous actors on the planet, thus, it only makes sense that fans want to know the details about Ryan Gosling's private life.</p><p>In truth, the actor is among the more private in Hollywood, choosing to separate his work and family life. Eva Mendes was asked about her husband's ways on Instagram, and how he doesn't get out much - <a href=#>Mendes replied to the fan by stating she wouldn't want things any other way.</a></p><p>"No thank you, I'm good. Rather be home with my man than anywhere else in the world."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Everyone Ryan Gosling And Eva Mendes Dated Before Finding Love Together</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Speculation has run wild as to why the couple rarely is seen or talks about their personal lives - so much so that Mendes had to make a statement, <a href=#>telling the world that everything is fine between herself and the family.</a></p><p>“I’m posting less because I really want to be present for my family,” the star responded at the time. “My little ones need me and posting takes up too much time. As far as getting work done, I’ll do that whenever I please. But no, that’s not the reason. The reason is I personally cannot juggle family and social media.”</p><p>Ryan did get a little more open during a recent interview, discussing the tough part of fatherhood during the pandemic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ryan-gosling-put-a-major-focus-on-fatherhood-during-the-pandemic>Ryan Gosling Put A Major Focus On Fatherhood During The Pandemic</h2><p>For Gosling, it was quite the task to keep his children entertained during quarantine, especially given that they weren't able to see or communicate with others of their age during that time. The actor joked about doing the toughest acting of his life during that time, but not to much avail with the kids.</p><p><a href=#>He discussed the tough process alongside In Style</a>, "Our kids were at a difficult age not to be able to see other kids and interact with people, even though Eva and I did our best,"</p><p>"More acting in quarantine than in our films.

Mendes spoke about why she decides to rarely post anything family-related via social media.</p><h2 id=eva-mendes-keeps-private-about-ryan-gosling-and-their-kids-because-she-doesn-t-have-their-consent>Eva Mendes Keeps Private About Ryan Gosling And Their Kids Because She Doesn't Have Their Consent</h2><p>So why doesn't either of the two post about family? Mendes revealed that it just works for them to keep things quiet. "As far as Ryan and I," she continued, "it just works for us this way, to stay private."</p><p>In addition, Mendes revealed alongside E News that she doesn't want to post about her kids and Ryan <a href=#>given that she doesn't have their consent.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I have always had a clear boundary when it comes to my man and my kids," the 47-year-old actress explained to an Instagram follower in 2020. "I'll talk about them of course, with limits, but I won't post pictures of our daily life. And since my children are still so little and don't understand what posting their image really means, I don't have their consent. And I won't post their image until they're old enough to give me consent."</p><p>Ultimately, things are different in terms of their careers, with Mendes admitting that she wouldn't oppose working alongside her hubby in a project on the big screen.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>Ryan Gosling Saved His Career By Turning Down This Film</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdrLJuusSvnKtlmJqus3nAm6aurF2nxqK6jKCmrKSZo7S0ec%2Beqaynnpa5brjIn5xo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./farrah-abraham-green-bikini-miami-beach-pics.html><span>←</span><span>Teen Moms Farrah Abraham Defies Gravity With Open Bikini Top As She Takes A Dip In Miami</span></a>
