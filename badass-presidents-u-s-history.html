Back in 1952, while he was a nuclear specialist in the Navy, Carter was sent to Ontario, Canada, where an experimental nuclear reactor had gone into partial meltdown and flooded the reactor building's basement with radioactive water. To save the day, Carter and his team needed to dismantle the reactor core—however, the radiation levels were so high, they could only be exposed for 90 seconds at a time, and they only had hand tools. So they took turns entering the reactor, working as fast as they could, and getting right the hell out.</p><p>Slowly, the work got done, but not before they all received massive doses of radiation—so much, in fact, that their urine was still coming out radioactive months later.
