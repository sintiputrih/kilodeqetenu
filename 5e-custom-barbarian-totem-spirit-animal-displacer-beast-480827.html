I thought of the effects of the spell Mirror Image being applied as the barbarian enters rage, but would three mirror images be too overpowered?

The effects of taking a malevolent evil monstrosity as a totem will be explored as her character develops.</p><p>Mechanically, I'm looking for a balanced Aspect of the Beast option.</p><p>I thought of the effects of the spell Mirror Image being applied as the barbarian enters rage, but would three mirror images be too overpowered? Would one or two be a better fit?</p><p>Does anyone have any better ideas?</p><p>Thanks!</p><br>One thing to keep in mind is that Aspect of the Beast totems do not typically give combat abilities, so I would not do so with the displacer beast totem. See below for my suggestions across all levels for this path.<p><b>TOTEM SPIRIT</b><br>At 3rd level, when you adopt this path, you choose a totem spirit and gain its feature. You must make or acquire a physical totem object -an amulet or similar adornment—that incorporates fur or feathers, claws, teeth, or bones of the totem animal. At your option. You also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent of your totem spirit. For example. if you have a hear totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thick-skinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn bright yellow.</p><p>Your totem animal might be an animal related to those listed here but more appropriate to your homeland. For example. you could choose a hawk or vulture in place of an eagle.</p><p><b>Displacer Beast:</b> At 3rd level, while raging, you project a magical illusion that makes it appear that you are standing near your actual location, causing attack rolls against you to have disadvantage. If you are hit by an attack, this trait is disrupted until the end of your next turn. This trait is also disrupted while you are incapacitated or have a speed of zero.</p><p><b>ASPECT OF THE BEAST</b><br>At 6th level, you gain a magical benefit based on the totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected at 3rd level or a different one.</p><p><b>Displacer Beast:</b> You are adept at ambushing your foes. If you have at least one minute to prepare, you have advantage on all stealth checks to conceal yourself. (If you feel this is too weak, you could give advantage on all stealth checks.)</p><p>OR</p><p><b>Displacer Beast:</b> You gain darkvision out to 60 feet.</p><p><b>SPIRIT WALKER</b><br>At 10th level, you can cast the <i>commune with nature</i> spell, but only as a ritual. When you do so, a spiritual version of one of the animals you chose for Totem Spirit or Aspect of the Beast appears to you to convey the information you seek.</p><p><b>TOTEMIC ATTUNEMENT</b><br>At 14th level, you gain a magical benefit based on a totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected previously or a different one.</p><p><b>Displacer Beast:</b> While raging, if you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail .</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7prrWqKmlnF6kv6h706GpnpmUqHx2sYycrKysn6J6o63Rm5iroZGjerW7056kZqugnr%2BqwIyapaKlkaF6pbXSqaOam5WneqOxwKyrZ2xoZYVzg44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./film-noir-movies-perfect.html><span>←</span><span>13 Film Noir Movies That Are Perfect From Start to Finish</span></a>
