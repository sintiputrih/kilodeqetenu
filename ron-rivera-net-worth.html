His job was to cover the Chicago Bears and college football. Four years later, he began working as a defensive quality control coach of the Bears.</p><p>Ron then joined the Philadelphia Eagles in 1999 to work under the head coach <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Andy Reid</strong></a> as the team’s linebackers coach. He worked with the Eagles for five years, and they even advanced to the NFC championship for three consecutive seasons.</p><p>In 2004, the Chicago Bears hired him as their defensive coordinator. In the 2006 season, he earned $500,000 as <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">a salary from</a> the team but left soon after. He later worked with the San Diego Chargers in various positions from 2007 to 2010.</p><p>Then, in January 2011, Carolina Panthers hired him as their head coach. He reportedly signed a four-year contract worth $11.2 million with the team. He secured a 3-year contract extension with the Panthers in 2016, which was worth $19.5 million.</p><p>Ron again signed a two-year deal with the Carolina Panthers.

According to Celebrity Net Worth, he received $7 million as an annual base salary during his time with the Panthers.</p><p>In January 2020, the Washington Redskins named him their new head coach. Rivera signed a five years deal with the team. However, the contract details have not been made public yet.
