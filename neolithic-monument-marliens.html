In April 2024, archaeologists unearthed an unprecedented prehistoric monument in Marliens, France. This monument features two enormous horseshoe-shaped structures surrounding a circular one, similar to a bowtie.
The monument, as well as a nearby necropolis, contain artifacts and weapons from several historical periods, including the Early Bronze Age, Middle Bronze Age, and the Early Iron Age."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Its center featured a circle flanked by two horseshoe-shaped structures. On its left side, the monument was fragmented, leaving the structure open.</p><p>Both sides of the structure had a layer of gravel, pointing to the existence of a palisade at some point. Soil and rock layers show that the structure was built all at once.</p><p>Alongside the structure, archaeologists discovered a handful of artifacts from various historical periods. The earliest were a bundle of seven flint arrowheads, two archer’s wrist braces, a flint lighter, and a copper alloy dagger from the Early Bronze Age (2800–1800 B.C.E.).</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-490004 alt="Neolithic Artifacts From France" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/archer-artifacts.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-490004 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Pauline Rostollan/INRAP</span><span class=caption-body>Objects belonging to Neolithic archers that were found in and around the Marliens monument.</span></p><p>From the Middle Bronze Age (1500 and 1300 B.C.E.), archaeologists discovered copper alloy pins, 40 amber beads, and ceramics.

Researchers discovered seeds, fruits, and nuts preserved in the clay of these pits which may shed light on how humans once used the site.</p><p>Additionally, researchers believe they’ve uncovered a Middle Bronze Age necropolis near the site. While human bones would not have survived centuries in this acidic soil, remnants of a pyre remain.</p><p>Archaeologists also discovered evidence that the area served burial purposes, including Iron Age cremation urns. In total, researchers have found six cremation urns and jewelry offerings as well as iron oxide used to light fires at a necropolis 400 meters away.</p><p>Some of these artifacts likely belonged to the Bell Beaker culture that emerged in Europe over 4,500 years ago, <a href=# rel=noopener>according to INRAP</a>.</p><p>Currently, researchers are awaiting results from radiocarbon testing to date several artifacts and to uncover more information about the prehistoric Europeans behind this baffling site.</p><p>After reading about this Neolithic monument, dive into the story of <a href=#>how the ancient Egyptian Pyramids were built</a>.
