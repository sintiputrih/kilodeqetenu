They obeyed the whims of their masters but were notoriously independent, willing to change loyalties within an instant.<h2>Why do Hellcats come with 2 keys?</h2>Introduced as the third generation Challenger received its facelift the Hellcat name has gone from strength to strength and seen plenty of successful iterations from the more powerful Redeye to the Widebody. The SRT Hellcat's two-key system makes cars safer and highly practical.<h2>What car can beat a Demon?</h2>The 2019 Challenger SRT Hellcat Redeye reveal was done as Challenger fans were mourning the end of the Demon. Under the hood is a 6.2-liter supercharged V8 engine that produces 797 horses and 707 pound-feet of torque.
