In anticipation of the premiere of the HBO drama’s eighth and final season on Sunday, April 14, the beloved restaurant chain has launched a pair of limited-edition menu items that pay homage to the book-based program.</p><p>The duo – a burger and a shake – first debuted earlier this month at Shake Shack’s Madison Square Park location in New York City, but starting on Friday, April 12, the GOT-focused menu items will be available nationwide. Customers across the country will have the opportunity to order a Dragonglass Shake and/or a Dracarys Burger.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Game-of-Thrones-Shake-Shack-Menu-02.jpg><p>The shake, which is expected to cost around $6.49, is jokingly billed as a “prime example of the Wall to Table movement,” a clear nod to the critically acclaimed show’s infamous colossal barrier. Known as “Zīrtom Perzomy Rholītsos” in Valyrian, the beverage consists of frozen custard and packed snow that has been “harvested beyond the Wall and hand churned by members of the Night’s Watch.” Final prep for the drink occurs in Winterfell, where the shake is “topped with shards of Dragonglass imported from the caves of Dragonstone.”</p><p>The item description also cheekily notes: “Please note supplies are limited as the Wall is currently undergoing major renovations.”</p><p>The Dracarys Burger (a.k.a. “Drakaro Parkliapos”) features a double Monterey Jack cheeseburger sourced from the “finest head of cattle The Seven Kingdoms has to offer.” Griddled by the fires of Drogon and Rhaegal, the burger is then topped with a fiery ShackSauce created from herbs and spices sourced from the conquered cities of Yunhai, Meeren and Astapor. The final touch are slabs of bacon imported from Essos, which is apparently “a Dothraki delicacy.” As Shake Shack warns, this meat-centric dish “may be too hot for non-Targaryens.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Game-of-Thrones-Shake-Shack-Menu-03.jpg><p>The Dragonglass Shake is slated be available through May 19 at Shacks nationwide (excluding stadiums, ballparks, transit centers and airports) whereas the Dracarys Burger is expected to be around through April 21, while supplies last. Starting Friday, the shake can be purchased at select Shacks across New York, L.A., Chicago, Dallas, Houston, D.C., Miami, Las Vegas, Denver, Philadelphia and Boston.</p><p>Customers can order these items in a participating Shake Shack outpost, on the chain’s app, or via web ordering. And for those who want to order like a pro, requests spoken in Valyrian will be honored. In fact, Shake Shack went so far as to include a pronunciation guide, which will likely be helpful for those not fluent in the fictional language.</p><p>In celebration of the national rollout, the New York-based eatery will bring the iconic Dragonstone Throne to the West Village Shake Shack in New York City on Friday. From 10 a.m. to 11 p.m., guests will have a chance to sit on the throne and rule Castle Shack, but RSVP is required, so click <a href=#>here</a> if you’re interested!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyvsdasZqygkaCybr%2FHmpqkZaSkeq2t1KeaoWWXlrqmec6fZK2goqS7pr%2BMppynrV2ewaa50madqKpdm7avrctmqp6Zo6S7cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./juju-watkins-net-worth-how-rich-is-she-explore-her-nil-and-contract-details.html><span>←</span><span>JuJu Watkins Net Worth | How Rich Is She | Explore Her NIL And Contract Details</span></a>
