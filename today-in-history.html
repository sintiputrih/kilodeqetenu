He was beheaded in Old Palace Yard.</p><h2>1929: The Stock Market Crashes On ‘Black Tuesday’</h2><p>The New York Stock Exchange crashes, helping to trigger the <a href=# rel=noopener>Great Depression</a>. Stock prices had been falling since September, and they plummeted starting on Oct. 18, leading to “Black Monday” on Oct. 28, and “Black Tuesday” on Oct. 29 as shareholders sought to take their money out in a panic.</p><p>Overnight, billions of dollars disappeared while the Dow lost 23.05 percent. The American stock market crash came just a month after the London Stock Exchange crashed in September, leading to a global financial meltdown that lasted until World War II.</p><h2>1956: The Suez Crisis Begins</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-389903 alt="Suez Crisis" width=900 height=675 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/suez-crisis.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-389903 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Fox Photos/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>A young Egyptian boy stands among rubble during the Suez Crisis. A British tank is parked behind him.</span></p><p>The Suez Crisis begins when Israel — joined by France and the United Kingdom — invades Egypt. Also known as the Second Arab–Israeli War or the Sinai War, the conflict began because Israel, France, and the U.K. hoped to regain ownership of the Suez Canal, which had been nationalized by Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser.</p><p>But the Soviet Union threatened to bomb Europe, and the United States threatened Israel, France, and the United Kingdom with economic sanctions. The “war” lasted just nine days before the three allied powers withdrew from Egypt in defeat.</p><h2>1969: Bobby Seale Is Gagged During Trial</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Bobby Seale</a> is gagged and chained to his seat while standing trial for his role in organizing protests during the 1968 Democratic National Convention.

This lasted for several days of the trial before his case was severed from the other seven men. Seale was later sentenced to 48 months in prison for 16 acts of contempt.</p><h2>2015: China Ends One-Child Policy</h2><p>China ends the one-child policy after 35 years. In the 1970s, China feared overpopulation and began implementing restrictions on the marrying age for adults, the number of children a couple could have, and the time intervals between children. The one-child policy was just one way the Chinese government hoped to curb overpopulation, and they strongly enforced it, primarily in urban centers.</p><p>By 2015, the Chinese government extended the limit to two children per family. In 2021, it was extended again to three children before being scrapped altogether.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony1u8OasGahnmK1qr%2FTqKmyZ5%2BYwbCuxKtka3E%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gaurav-arora-height-weight-net-worth-age-wiki-who-instagram-biography-34326-html.html><span>←</span><span>Gaurav Arora Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
