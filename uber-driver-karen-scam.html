Like a Miami doctor who went on a drunken rampage against an Uber driver, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">attacking him and destroying his vehicle while insulting him the entire time.</a></p><p>And just from a monetary perspective, there are certain scams that passengers try to play on drivers in an attempt to get a free ride, which could have financial implications for the driver, or even get them in trouble with the app should they pick up the wrong person and the intended customer ended up shilling out for a ride that never showed up.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><span>Source: YouTube | @Dustin is Driving</span></figure><p>That's what appears to happen in this video uploaded to the Dustin is Driving YouTube account, which is titled, "Karens Gets Mad When Uber Driver Does NOT Say Her Name."</p><p>You might be wondering to yourself, well what's the big deal? Why won't the Uber Driver say her name? There are a few reasons for this.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>An Uber driver who scams.

Those requests are usually made in the app themselves, but it's much better to just avoid that situation entirely than having to stop a car and kick someone out of your vehicle while you're already driving.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Not really because that's the way the scam works, I say the riders name, the person says yes and when they get in the car they say they've changed their mind to change address and they've just stole your Uber.

You report, Uber takes fare from driver.</p>‚Äî Awwcool (@Awwcool1) <a href=#>January 12, 2020</a> <span>Source: Twitter | @Awwcool1</span></figure><p>In Dustin's clip, we can see the woman in question becoming irate with the fact that he won't say her name first, because then she could just lie and say that is her name (securing the free ride). While there were some commenters who thought that his attitude and the way he handled the entire situation could've been improved upon, others also expressed that they understood where he was coming from.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube | @Dustin is Driving</span></figure><p>Some also theorized that perhaps the woman in question wasn't exactly trying to score herself a free ride, but rather was a "Karen" who got into a petty argument with the driver and just wanted him to do what she said. In any event, it seems like he saved himself the trouble of having to spend time in the car with the individual.</p><p>Do you think the Uber driver acted accordingly?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqq%2BmvoydqaKulad6rK3RnqVmq5OWug%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./look-of-the-day-2023-08-18-7693075.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Sofa Vergara Wore the Quintessential Fall Pants Even Oprah Owns</span></a>
