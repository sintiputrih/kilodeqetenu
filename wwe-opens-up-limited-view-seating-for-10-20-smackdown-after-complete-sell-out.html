We will have to see if they can pull a repeat performance this week, but they are certainly looking good this week for the October 20th episode of the blue brand.</p><p>Limited view seating is never preferred, but sometimes fans have to accept what view they can get for the show. Wrestle Tix reports that WWE is opening up even more seats, so they can sell more tickets for this week’s episode.</p><p>WWE Smackdown Fri • Oct 20 • 6:45 PM</p><p>Frost Bank Center, San Antonio, TX</p><p>Tickets Distributed => 13,695 SOLD OUT.</p><p>It’s possible they release some production kills or other holds as the day goes on.</p><p>“UPDATE: A few more limited view sections opened up and are moving (and being relisted).”</p><p>In the last few WWE events held in San Antonio, the attendance figures saw 7,958 fans on July 11th, 2022 for a Raw even. On December 3rd, 2021, another Raw event drew a crowd of 6,718. Finally, on August 16th, 2021, during yet another Raw event, the attendance reached 7,923 fans.</p><p>We will have to see how WWE SmackDown turns out this week.
