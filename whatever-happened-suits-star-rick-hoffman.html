It was announced in February 2020 that he would play a recurring role as Dr. Swerlow on Showtime's "Billions" for Season 5. The character is a foul-mouthed doctor who sports a pair of trademark sunglasses. Hoffman returned&nbsp;for Season 7 and met with Paul Giamatti's Chuck and Ben Shenkman's Ira at a mountain retreat.</p><p dir=ltr>According to Hoffman, "Billions" star Dave Costabile helped him get the part. Costabile, who plays Mike "Wags" Wagner on the Showtime series, had appeared on 16 episodes of "Suits." "[H]e was directing his first episode on 'Billions,' and there was a role as a doctor that had one scene. And he said he thought I'd be perfect for it," Hoffman said during a 2020 <a href=#>YouTube interview</a> with Amanda Geffner. At first, the seasoned TV actor had reservations about playing Dr. Swerlow. "I was like, 'Listen, guys, I was thinking of a little something different after 'Suits.' I don't want to be a one and out,'" Hoffman recalled telling the "Billions" executives. Once Hoffman was on board, the staff decided to expand the character outside of that single episode.</p><p dir=ltr>Even after working on "Billions," Hoffman still had a fondness for the series he was best remembered for. "'Suits' will always be something ... that can't be replaced," he told Geffner. Afterward, another former collaborator helped Hoffman land another meaty role.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxkboR1g46wn5qslauys3nHmqepnZ6asW6%2F1KKrrGWjqa6zedGimqRlmKSzp7nAp2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./simplisafe-battery-replacement.html><span>←</span><span>SimpliSafe battery life and replacement tips</span></a>
