Combined with Glitterdust, I’d say they were close to the 2 most effective Arcane spells in both campaigns, even when the PC’s were in the mid-teens level-wise.<p>Several combats were turned into cakewalks due to the enemy being greased and blinded. If he fails his save he’s on the ground, reducing his melee AC by 4 and his attack bonus by 4. So he’s easier to hit and it’s harder for him to attack back. If he passes his save, then chances he doesn’t have 5 ranks in Balance and can be sneak attacked. Add to this Glitterdust, that blinds on a failed save. That drops his AC by at least 2 (more if he has a Dex bonus to AC) and gives everyone a 50% miss chance (assuming they can figure out what square the attack came from).</p><p>So you can see how the combo is horribly effective. Yes, they are low-level spells, so the saving throws are lower. However, if they PC has an INT of 20+ (fairly likely by the mid-teen levels) and taken a feat to increase the DC for spells from those schools, the saving throws are likely to be in the high teens, which is not that easy.</p><p>Of course, much of the problem is caused by the fact that as a DM, I seem to roll poorly for saves for the bad guys! I don’t know what it is, but it seems that when it comes to saving throws, the dice suddenly hate me.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7prrWqKmlnF6kv6h706GpnpmUqHylscCloKefXay2tbSMoKmemaOae3SAl29vb2c%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-read-all-the-harry-potter-books-in-order.html><span>←</span><span>How many Harry Potter books are there?</span></a>
