When asked what she appreciates about the Spider-Man actor, she indeed gushed over her costar; however, she focused on his work ethic and dedication to playing the superhero.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"There are many things, obviously, that I appreciate. In an actor way, I appreciate that he really loves being Spider-Man. It's a lot of pressure—you take on the role of a superhero wherever you go. To the little kid who walks by, you are Spider-Man. I think he handled that so well," she said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She also shared her experience watching Holland perform multiple takes while filming the Marvel Cinematic Universe trilogy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"And seeing him at work, even though he's not a Virgo [laughs], he is a perfectionist," she said, referring to her own sun sign. "Our director allowed me to come in every day [of the shoot], and it was cool to see how he cares so much about his work and making it right. I watched him do a fight scene all day, which is exhausting. He'd do a move, come back to the monitors, watch it, and say, 'I can do that better.' I'd be like, 'Dude, you got it.' But he wants us to be perfect, and I really appreciate that."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Though she didn't confirm her relationship in the interview, it did seem like she's been spending a lot of time with the British actor.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Yeah, he's a fun time," she said. "Very charismatic, can make anybody feel comfortable and have a good laugh and a good chat. A good chat—I sound so British."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The pair were photographed <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a36916960/zendaya-and-tom-holland-seen-kissing-in-a-car-la/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="kissing in a car" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">kissing in a car</a> in L.A. last July. And though neither of them has spoken publicly about their relationship, they have shared several sweet moments, including Holland's <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a37454135/tom-holland-zendaya-birthday-tribute-instagram/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Instagram tribute" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Instagram tribute</a> for Zendaya's 25th birthday last month. The Brit, also 25, shared a pic of the pair looking in a mirror in a makeup trailer on set of the MCU trilogy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"My MJ, have the happiest of birthdays.
