Edie Falco earned her net worth through her many acting roles in movies and television series, such as The Sopranos, and Nurse Jackie. Born Edith Falco on July 5, 1963, in Brooklyn, New York, she made a name for herself in the world of TV as a cast member of highly-acclaimed series “The Sopranos”. But apart from her rise as a suburban New Jersey mother and conflicted wife of an organized crime boss named Carmela Soprano, she had accumulated an acting resume that offers much more. Raised in Long Island, Falco studied at the SUNY Purchase, where she was trained in acting at the prestigious Conservatory of Theater Arts and Film. Once she equipped herself with proper training, Edie Falco moved to Manhattan to pursue an acting career. She started getting film roles, mostly minor parts, in the late 1980s. As her first notable turn comes her supporting role in Bullets Over Broadway (1994). Shortly after, she landed regular roles on the gritty prison series “Oz” (HBO, 1997-99) and police dramas including “Law & Order” (NBC, 1990-2010), as well as “Homicide: Life on the Street” (NBC, 1993-99). Once she joined the cast of “The Sopranos” (HBO, 1999-2007), Edie Falco fetched multiple Emmy and Golden Globe awards for playing the iconic Mrs. Soprano. She has since remained in the spotlight, this time with the lead of “Nurse Jackie” (Showtime, 2009- ), a dark comedy based on a brilliant, but drug-addicted emergency room nurse. This was just another chance for Falco to put on show her considerable acting prowess.</p><p><strong>Edie Falco Salary</strong><br>What is Edie Falco’s salary per episode of Nurse Jackie? $175,000</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fmrGqsYyfmKWbn6h6r7HTZq6oqqSdeqO1zqCpmqiYrnqnrcKtZJyZopqys3nAsJirnKNirq%2BwjKWgn51dqMGwvtho</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ava-cota-dancer-wiki-bio-age-height-weight-measurements-bf-net-worth-facts.html><span>←</span><span>Ava Cota (Dancer) Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Weight, Measurements, BF, Net Worth, Facts</span></a>
