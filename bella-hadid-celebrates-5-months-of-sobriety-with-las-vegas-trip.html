She shared more of her sobriety celebration with fans via TikTok by posting a video of herself <a href=#>happily twirling around at a casino</a>, which she captioned, “5 months alcohol free.”</p><p>She showed off her red monochrome ensemble once more in another TikTok posted Monday, featuring herself and a friend <a href=#>fanning themselves with feathered fans</a> as a sped-up version of <a href=#><strong>Mariah Carey</strong></a>’s “<a href=#>It’s A Wrap</a>” played.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bella-Hadid-Celebrates-5-Months-of-Sobriety-on-Vegas-Trip-With-Friends-2.jpg><p>In addition to commemorating her sobriety achievement, Hadid — who <a href=#>confirmed her romance</a> with boyfriend <strong>Marc Kalman</strong> in July 2021 — revealed that the true reason for her trip was to celebrate her non-alcoholic drink brand Kin Euphorics’ partnership with the iconic Las Vegas hotel, Caesars Palace.</p><p>“We are so excited to announce that Kin will be available and stocked throughout the minibars/in-rooms and across all 6 towers, pools, bars, restaurants, and lounges including the world-famous Omnia nightclub!!!!” <a href=#>she captioned more Vegas pics</a> in another Instagram post on Monday.</p><p>The California native went on to describe how bringing Kin to Vegas was a major goal for herself and Kin Euphorics cofounder and CEO, <strong>Jen Batchelor</strong>.</p><p>“We wanted to make sure that we were available to not only the health and wellness communities worldwide, but genuinely passionate about different communities ability to access & utilize the benefits of @kineuphorics in any field or place that they were in,” she added. “We really want the world of Vegas to try us and let us know how you feel! We want Kin to be used at all times of the day, <a href=#>with or without alcohol</a>, whenever/whatever you need to stay healthy, uplifted, energetic and able to party on.”</p><p>Hadid revealed she had stopped drinking in 2021 in a January 2022 interview with <a href=#>InStyle</a>. “I have done my fair share of drinking. I loved alcohol and it got to the point where even I started to, you know, cancel nights out that I felt like I wouldn’t be able to control myself,” the former <a href=#>Victoria’s Secret</a> Angel shared at the time, adding that it became “a lot harder to pick up the glass” after seeing brain scans of how alcohol affects her brain.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bella-Hadid-Celebrates-5-Months-of-Sobriety-on-Vegas-Trip-With-Friends-3.jpg><p>She went one to explain why she couldn’t see herself picking up drinking again since trying Kin Euphorics. “I don’t feel the need because I know how it will affect me at 3 in the morning when I wake up with horrible anxiety thinking about that one thing I said five years ago when I graduated high school,” Hadid — who previously dated <a href=#><strong>The Weeknd</strong></a> on and off <a href=#>from 2015 to 2019</a> — noted. “There’s just this never-ending effect of, essentially, you know, pain and stress over those few drinks that didn’t really do much, you know?”</p><p>Batchelor, meanwhile, previously opened up about her partnership with Hadid in an exclusive interview with <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>. “We love creating together and imagining a world where Kin can fit into any aspect of your intentional lifestyle,” she said in October 2022. “[Hadid] helps me keep the embers burning for that future-world vision and also honors my love for the scientific and decidedly nostalgic.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGabnZyhrm60wJ2gnWWTmrmmrtGaq56rXWp6rrvNrZ%2BsZZ%2BberS7waugnqypYsSqwMdmo5qrXauyqK3SZquroaBk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./travis-barker-son-landon-20-shares-upsetting-family-news-i-love-you-all-so-much.html><span>←</span><span>Travis Barker's son Landon, 20, shares upsetting family news - 'Love you all so much'</span></a>
