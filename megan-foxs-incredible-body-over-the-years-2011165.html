After the birth of her eldest son, Noah, the New Girl alum opened up about the very strict diet she was following.</p><p dir=ltr>“I cut out all bread and those sort of carbohydrates,” she revealed to <a href=#>E! News</a> in 2014. “No crackers, no pretzels, no chips. Nothing unhealthy. The worst thing I put in my body is coffee, once a day. I don’t have any cheat days but if I did, it would be pizza or cake.”</p><p dir=ltr>In addition to keeping up with a healthy food regimen, Fox made sure to incorporate exercise. While training for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, her trainer at the time, <strong>Harley Pasternak</strong>, exclusively told Us Weekly <a href=#>what she was doing to get in shape</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>“She’s someone who naturally doesn’t love working out traditionally,” the fitness expert explained in 2014. “She has really adopted this great consistency and this great approach to working out; it started during her first pregnancy and has carried on through now.”</p><p dir=ltr>The Holiday in the Sun actress has often been subjected to sexualization by the industry and has been vocal about such treatment over the years, including in regards to Jennifer’s Body.</p><p dir=ltr>“It wasn’t just that movie, it was every&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; day of my life, all the time, with every project I worked on and every producer I worked with,” she told <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> in September 2019. “It preceded a breaking point for me. I think I had a genuine psychological breakdown where I wanted just nothing to do.”</p><p dir=ltr>Fox continued, “I didn’t want to be seen, I didn’t want to have to take a photo, do a magazine, walk a carpet, I didn’t want to be seen in public at all because the fear, and the belief, and the absolute certainty that I was going to be mocked, or spat at, or someone was going to yell at me, or people would stone me or savage me for just being out… so I went through a very dark moment after that.”</p><p dir=ltr>As of June 2020, Fox <a href=#>began dating</a> rapper <a href=#><strong>Machine Gun Kelly</strong></a>, and the two <a href=#>got engaged in January 2022</a>. One year later, Fox opened up about her struggles with body dysmorphia. “I don’t ever see myself the way other people see me,” <a href=#>she said in her cover story</a> for Sports Illustrated’s <a href=#>2023 swimsuit edition</a> that May. “There is never a point in my life where I loved my body, never, ever.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She went on to note that she’s had an “awareness” of her body image from a young age. “It definitely wasn’t environmental because I grew up in a very religious environment where bodies weren’t even, like, acknowledged,” Fox continued. “The journey of, like, loving myself is gonna be never-ending, I think.”</p><p dir=ltr>Scroll down to see how Fox has evolved through the years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58sbXCrayrnaNkuqazwKdkn6eoqHqqusKrnJ2hkqGybq7OnbBmp6aav27Ax55ksp2Rp8Bufo9qaGpuZWS7sMLEppmeql1nfXJ%2BjG5m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jinder-mahal-age-height-weight.html><span>←</span><span>Jinder Mahal Age, Height, Weight</span></a>
