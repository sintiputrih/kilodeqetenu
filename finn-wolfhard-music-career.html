Fact: Finn Wolfhard’s acting chops are not in question. The Stranger Things alum cemented that his star is on the rise with his turn as a semi-tortured Hawkins teen. His turn as Ziggy in When You Finish Saving the World only proves that Finn is not going anywhere soon."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Here are the details.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: A24</span><p>Finn Wolfhard as Ziggy Katz in 'When You Finish Saving the World'</p></figure><p>Fact: <a href=#>Finn Wolfhard</a>’s acting chops are not in question. The <a href=#>Stranger Things</a> alum cemented that his star is on the rise with his turn as a semi-tortured Hawkins teen. His turn as Ziggy in <a href=#>When You Finish Saving the World</a> only proves that Finn is not going anywhere soon.</p><p>But what fans may not know is that <a href=#>Mike Wheeler</a>’s alter ego also has an established music career. Here’s what we know about Finn’s involvement in not one, but two bands.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Finn Wolfhard’s music career is very much a part of his future.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>As the star told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fast Company</a> in 2020, “I’ve known what I’ve wanted to do with my life since I was really young.” Indeed, as a child, Finn enjoyed entertaining his family and caught the acting bug early. His parents and his voice actor <a href=#>brother Nick</a> turned Finn on to movies — and music — early on.</p><p>While fans are familiar with Finn’s Hollywood career, what is less well known is that he also has a passion for jamming out. His first collaboration was with Ayla Tesler-Mabe, Jack Anderson, and Malcolm Craig in the band Calpurnia, which dissolved in 2019, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billboard</a>, despite achieving success early on.</p><p>In an Instagram post announcing <a href=#>the end of the band</a>, the group said in part, “We feel lucky and hugely grateful for the many fantastic opportunities that came our way. We’re all going to be starting fresh chapters in our lives: new projects, new music, new creative ventures, and new experiences to come.”</p><p>That next opportunity for Finn, who is <a href=#>no longer single</a>, incidentally, included joining another band. This time, the group is a duo, The Aubreys, which is a lower key venture for the actor, who admitted to feeling overwhelmed by Calpurnia’s ascension. So what role does the actor play in this band?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Can Finn Wolfhard sing? Yes, and he can do even more than that.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Finn Wolfhard (@finnwolfhardofficial)</a></p></figure><p>The Aubreys, which consists of Finn and Malcolm, the drummer from Calpurnia, is an indie rock band that released its first EP, "Soda & Pie," in 2020, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Teen Vogue</a>. Finn brought his singer-songwriter <a href=#>talent</a>, as well as his guitar skills, to the duo, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PopSugar</a>, and counts Led Zeppelin and The Beatles among his musical influences.</p><p>Take a gander at The Aubreys’ music video for “Smoke Bomb” and judge Finn's music career for yourself. Our vote? He is clearly good at basically everything. Either way, it seems that the It star is just having a good time making songs with his childhood pal, telling Fast Company about his second band, “We realized, ‘Oh, this is what the music part of our life should be: just us jamming in our basement.'”</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>The star also shared a funny story about how the duo got its moniker. “Initially our band was called the Audreys and that was because it was named after a childhood cat that I had. But there’s another band called the Audreys, so we just swapped the ‘d’ with the ‘b’ and we thought it just sounded cool,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfm7avuoywpqWemJa%2FpXnMrqqim12YrrOxxKs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./andrey-rublev-girlfriend-family-prize-money-net-worth-512716-html.html><span>←</span><span>Andrey Rublev: Girlfriend, Family, Prize Money &amp;amp; Net Worth</span></a>
