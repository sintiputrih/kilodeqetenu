According to the director:</p><p>“This man Jordan Peterson legitimizes some components of their movement because he’s a former professor, an author, and he dresses up, so they feel like this is a legitimate ideology that should be taken seriously.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Olivia-Wilde-1.jpg alt="Olivia Wilde" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Jordan Peterson and his daughter Mikhaila Peterson reacted to Olivia Wilde’s remarks after they became viral on the internet. Peterson, 60, replied to Wilde’s interview with the National Post while discussing Pine’s role being based on him. The author described Chris Pine as “a beautiful guy,” adding:</p><p>“I also hope that Chris Pine does the sartorial splendor of my very formal public wardrobe justice as he pillories me in the latest piece of propaganda disseminated by the woke, self-righteous bores and bullies who now dominate Hollywood, and who insist that the production of such tripe be prohibited.”</p><p>Mikhaila Peterson, his daughter, addressed Olivia Wilde’s remarks against her father in an Opposing Views podcast interview. Mikhaila made the statement while playing a tape from The Joe Rogan Experience podcast in which her father criticizes the incel mentality:</p><p>“Don’t worry, Darling, since my father is reportedly the king of the incels… My father is not an incel supporter.”</p><p></p><p>Jordan was also offended by the term “pseudo-intellectual” in Mikhaila’s Instagram video. He mentioned:</p><p>“I am by far the most mentioned psychologist in the department at the University of Toronto.”</p><p>While Wilde has not reacted to Jordan and Mikhaila Peterson’s replies, her film Don’t Worry Darling had a good Venice Film Festival debut. Wilde, along with Harry Styles, Florence Pugh, and Chris Pine, attended the event.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Jordan Peterson</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Olivia Wilde</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihqKqUlrtuvMStnKurn6PAbr7ErKeopqOaerW7jKijoq6Zlnq4tcudnKxln6W2r7XOp2Samp%2BqwW60yKZm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-nvidia-geforce-gtx-1080-ti-review.html><span>←</span><span>Driver Performance &amp;amp; The Test</span></a>
