He then claims to have helped launch Scott’s career by artificially boosting the streams of his songs online.</p><p>“For Travis, what we did was fake his popularity. I programmed a fleet of Soundcloud bots to artificially inflate his play counts on Soundcloud. This told record label executives that he was much more popular than he actually was. We also did the same thing early on with Twitter,” the man purported to be Morris said. “We used software to enhance his visibility via the wrong means,” he added.</p><p data-characters=89 data-current-count=89 data-injectable=false>On Saturday, Scott said he was “absolutely devastated by what took place last night.”</p><p>“My prayers go out to the families and all those impacted by what happened at Astroworld Festival.
