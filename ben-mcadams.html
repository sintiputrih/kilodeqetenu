He was hospitalized on Friday with “severe shortness of breath”.</p><p>After his diagnosis on Wednesday, 18th March, McAdams told the TODAY Show that his COVID-19 felt like “the worst cold I’ve ever had.” On Friday, after his symptoms got worse, he called the coronavirus hotline and was told to go to the hospital where he was met by staff in an isolation unit.</p><p>“I was admitted and have been receiving oxygen as I struggled to maintain my blood oxygen at appropriate levels. I am now off oxygen and feeling relatively better and expect to be released as soon as the doctors determine it is appropriate.”</p><p>McAdams said his experience “has shown me how critical it is to follow the advice of the CDC and the Utah Department of Health to stop the spread of this virus.” He also stated that his condition had since improved and he was “feeling relatively better.” However, he remains in the hospital, and would stay there until his doctors “determine it is appropriate.” Update: On Saturday, March 20th, he got discharged from the University of Utah Hospital.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-30352 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Ben-McAdams-updates-after-hospital-release.jpg alt="Ben McAdams " width=650 height=365 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-30352 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Ben McAdams updates about his release from Utah Hospital on Saturday, 20th March.

After the Supreme Court ruled in Obergefell v. Hodges that same-sex couples have the right to marry, McAdams stated: “As Justice Kennedy stated in his opinion, ‘The right of same-sex couples to marry is derived from the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection.’ This decision enshrines what I’ve long believed—that all families should be treated equally under the law.”</p><p>In 2019, McAdams voted for the Equality Act, which would legally prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in employment, housing, public accommodations, public education, federal funding, credit, and the jury system.
