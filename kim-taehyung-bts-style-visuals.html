He was born into the world with the beauty of a supermodel and the heart of an artist. His talent is monstrous — so absolutely enormous — that it's hard to describe and better to just experience it for yourself. Listening to a Kim Taehyung ballad means feeling understood deep down in your marrow. It is an embrace at your most lonesome. It is a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>blooming purple flower pushing out of the deepest snowdrift</a> of winter. It's love — pure and tender — delivered sonically.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Taehyung is a sweetly sentimental idol who is always affectionately reminding us through Weverse posts, tweets, and interviews that ARMY is his best friend. And, besties, doesn't that make your day a little better, knowing that this king is publicly declaring his devotion to you on the reg?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And his beauty. I would be remiss if I didn't mention that all that talent is wrapped up in legendarily gorgeous good looks. With a jawline that could cut a diamond, a smile that makes me as soft as a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>winter bear</a>, and a darkly handsome stare that, if trained on me directly for any amount of time I'm certain would make me astral project into another plane of existence, V has mastered his visuals to the point of weaponization. Oh, he knows exactly what he's doing to us. I can speak for all of ARMY when I tell you that, for the rest of our lives, we will never be able to look at a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>paperclip</a> again without blushing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So let's celebrate our best friend — the good boy of BTS — on this happy day. Grab your Tata mic and an Oreo McFlurry while I count down the ways V made us fall in love with him, over and over.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-tae-in-headbands-supremacy></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Tae in Headbands Supremacy</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images / Facebook / InStyle</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Oh, Kim Taehyung. The power that you hold over me when you're wearing a headband.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>that first Grammys performance</a> to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>the entire Mic Drop Era</a>, I'm always a sucker for V in a headband. It seems to change him, like slipping one on increases his confidence and swagger to levels that shouldn't be reached by mortals. This man means trouble at his resting state, but with a headband on he's downright dangerous. Truly, I do believe if I was seated too close to Tae Tae while he was wearing one, a single eyebrow raise in my direction would end my life.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">(If that does happen, please put it on my gravestone that I died doing what I loved: simping over Kim Taehyung.)</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-devoted-pom-daddy></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Devoted Pom Daddy</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images / Facebook / InStyle</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">OK, this isn't technically a Taehyung "era," but attention must be paid to how unrelentingly cute these two are together.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If V is your bias, then Yeontan is definitely your bias wrecker.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Little Tannie arrived in V's arms when he was just a teeny tiny puppy and has been doted on and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>spoiled by his dad and six uncles ever since</a>. From his little, round (winter) bear ears to the glorious dandelion poof of a tail, the black-and-tan fuzz ball is as adorable and elegant as his papa is. Another thing father and son have in common? <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>They're both excellent snugglers</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">V is so devoted to his baby that when GQ and Vogue Korea asked him to send a letter of gratitude to someone in his life, he chose Tan. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The short note</a> managed to break my heart and then glue all the pieces back together as V revealed his puppy has struggled with genetic health problems since birth. He ended the letter with a (translated) sentiment, "Thank you for staying strong and enduring, staying alive even though times are difficult, I hope we can make fun memories for the rest of our lives together, and I want to see a grown up Tannie."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-k-drama-worthy-overcoats></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>K-Drama Worthy Overcoats</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images / Facebook / InStyle</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There are a handful of signature Kim Taehyung pieces that make up his iconic wardrobe (Burberry pajamas, Celine tees, berets, and cool guy sunglasses to name a few), but nothing makes life worth living more than when he wears his long overcoats. V's personal style has evolved a lot since BTS's debut and you'll rarely see him in ripped up jeans (like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jungkook</a>) or the latest, unreleased-to-the-public hyped streetwear (like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>j-hope</a>). Instead, he prefers a clean, vintage aesthetic that pairs perfectly with his deep love of classic jazz music. But nothing does it for me more than when he wears his long, tailored overcoats. Maybe it's because he just looks so damn princely in them, like he's the lead in a deeply romantic k-drama. Please excuse me while I listen to "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Sweet Night</a>" for the billionth time and weep at the thought of V brooding, walking slowly through the rain.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-ultra-sexy-onstage-aesthetic></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Ultra-Sexy Onstage Aesthetic</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images / Facebook / InStyle</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Petition to change V's stage name to "High Pollen Count" because neither will let me breathe.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">SUGA once said that, "Once you come to our concert, you can't go anywhere else! You definitely can't!" Readers, I confess, it's true. One concert and you're locked onto this Bangtan Sonyeondan ride for life; and a good deal of that is thanks to V's charisma.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On stage, V is a next level version of hot. Beyond hot. Like burning-for-all-of-eternity-in-hell levels of hot. He seems deeply at home on the stage in front of thousands of screaming, deeply devoted fans. If you were lucky enough to witness the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>"holy shit" moment in LA last month</a> in person, buy a lottery ticket because you've been touched by an angel, bestie. Your life has been forever blessed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I know I'm having fun with the hyperbole here, but <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Kim Taehyung really is a wildly talented performer</a>. Easily one of the most talented of our generation. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>His music is healing</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>his deep, honey voice is unfathomably beautiful</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4>his dancing is outrageously charismatic</a>, and he's only getting better — have mercy on us, Kim Taehyung of Future Timelines.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-instagram-boyfriend-era></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Instagram Boyfriend Era</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images / Facebook / InStyle</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We're supposed to be on a break, Kim Taehyung? What was the reason for this?!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Immediately after their record-breaking mini-tour Permission to Dance in LA (which sold 214,000 tickets, earning $33.3 million, and injecting an estimated <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>$100+ million into the Los Angeles economy</a> thanks to ARMYs from all of the world converging on our pilgrimage), HYBE announced that the members would take a well-deserved break from the spotlight. They'd spend time with their families for the first holiday season since their debut — a significant reminder of the untold sacrifices they've made for their careers. We sighed happily for them, full of our post-concert memories and glow, and prepared ourselves for some quiet time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Of course they didn't let us rest.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Just a few hours later, to the surprise of everyone, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>BTS created 7 individual Instagrams</a>. Bless the exec who finally gave the green light for these men to manage their own accounts, but ARMY, we're barely surviving this Taehyung era.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Of all of BTS, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>V is the most prolific 'grammer</a> (followed closely by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>RM</a> who just took an American cross-country road trip visiting a bucket list worth of art museums, swoon!). Each new content drop causes a Twitter-trending meltdown for the helpless ARMYs who have their alerts on and functioning. Tae's Instagram is pure, uncut boyfriend aesthetic. It's exactly what your camera roll would look like if you were dating the idol: a clip of him driving a Mustang through Hawaii while playing jazz, pictures of Yeontan looking like a fuzzy gumdrop, a vid of V boiling ramen for dinner, and scream-inducing clavicle-baring shirtless selfies (featuring — omigod! — facial hair) that has completely shattered us.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_67-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kim Taehyung, what are you doing to us?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_69-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">…But please never stop.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8qipGaskZq1usHNoGSbrKNiwLXFy55kr6Gjqq6tvw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fan-gets-neck-tattoo-like-cody-rhodes-after-losing-bet-on-roman-reigns-at-wrestlemania.html><span>←</span><span>Fan Gets Neck Tattoo Like Cody Rhodes After Losing Bet on Roman Reigns at WrestleMania</span></a>
