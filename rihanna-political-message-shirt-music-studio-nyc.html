And while the t-shirt looks like it couldn’t cost more than $20, it’s actually part of edgy fashion brand Vetements’ luxury streetwear collection from its fall 2021 line. The shirt retails upwards of $350. But the good news? Thinking is totally free!</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The 33-year old multi-hyphenate arrived in NYC just one day after the stunning launch of her latest <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Savage x Fenty Vol. 3</a> lingerie line in Los Angeles Thursday Sept. 23. The star-studded launch featured the likes of supermodels <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Cindy Crawford</strong></a> and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Gigi Hadid</strong></a>, actress <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Vanessa Hudgens</strong></a>, popstar singer <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Normani</strong></a>, and even <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Madonna</strong></a>‘s daughter <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lourdes Leon</strong></a> helped show off the sexy undergarment line. The show premiered exclusively on Amazon Prime as it has done for its previous two collections.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rihanna-savage-fenty-vol-3-embed1-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>RiRi has kept the world waiting</a> for five long years for her next album. The Bad Gal last released her Anti album in 2016 before taking time off from music to focus on her fashion and beauty projects. Now that she’s crossed a few things off her to-do list, the songstress is working on an entirely different concept for her music. “You’re not going to expect what you hear. Just put that in your mind,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rihanna told the Associated Press</a> just before the launch of her latest lingerie line. There’s no official release date yet for the new album but if Rihanna keeps serving us these looks both off and on the runway, we’re happy to wait just a little while longer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH16e5FvZquhmJa7r62MqaaloaSesKK4jKacrKuRnLJuv8eiqa1lnarAqq%2BMrKuunJmkeq%2FFwmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./eduardo-gonzalez-bio-wife-age-barbecue-showdown.html><span>←</span><span>Eduardo Gonzalez Age, Wife, Who Is He?</span></a>
