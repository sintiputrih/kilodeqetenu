But as was common in the 19th century, the hospital quickly became a repository for anyone deemed unfit for polite society.</p><p>The Gothic Revival structure was colloquially known as Renwick Hospital and named after James Renwick Jr., who also designed both the Grace Church and St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York City before working on some additions to the smallpox hospital on Roosevelt Island.</p><p>In the 1800s, Roosevelt Island was still known as Blackwell’s Island for Robert Blackwell, whose family had been farming the land before the city purchased it in 1828. The island eventually became a repository for the city’s sick and criminal, as hospitals like the Smallpox Hospital and prisons were built there.</p><p>To its credit, Smallpox Hospital was perfectly situated as a quarantine hospital for infectious disease, as ferry access kept infected patients from infecting regular New Yorkers. And it did accomplish some good, as between 1856 and 1875, the now-abandoned hospital treated an estimated 7,000 people a year.</p><i class="fa fa-times"></i> <span class=caption-body>Back in the late 19th and early 20th century, the area was known as Blackwell's Island. In 1921, it was renamed Welfare Island because the hospital and its surrounding structures had fallen into disrepair.</span><span class=credit>Flickr</span> <span class=caption-body>Even though the smallpox vaccine was widely available by the early 1900s, the dense city of New York was still susceptible to large outbreaks.</span><span class=credit>Facebook</span> <span class=caption-body>Roosevelt Island was once called a "human rat trap" due to the decaying asylum there.</span><span class=credit>Flickr</span> <span class=caption-body>Today, "The Octagon" on Roosevelt Island is home to luxury apartments.</span><span class=credit>Facebook</span> <span class=caption-body>The façade of the Roosevelt Hospital.</span><span class=credit>Facebook</span> <span class=caption-body>The decaying facility has been featured in many movies, including 2002's Spider-Man.</span><span class=credit>Facebook</span> <span class=caption-body>The overgrown plants gave it a creepy, yet beautiful, appeal.</span><span class=credit>Flickr</span> <span class=caption-body>The moss-covered front of the smallpox hospital.</span><span class=credit>Instagram</span> <span class=caption-body>An overcast day at the smallpox hospital.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span> <img decoding=async alt="Roosevelt Smallpox Hospital Front" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img///allthatsinteresting.com/thumb/630.501.allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/roosevelt-smallpox-hospital-front.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Discover The Roosevelt Island Smallpox Hospital View Gallery<p>But seeing as it was a hospital of its day, the Smallpox Hospital often housed people who weren't even ill, including petty criminals, immigrants, and people with disabilities.</p><p>These patients were kept in deplorable conditions until 1887 when brazen journalist Nellie Bly went undercover as a patient there. Bly encountered widespread neglect and saw patients beaten by staff, malnourished, and one woman even died during Bly's stay.</p><p>Bly's damning exposé was published in New York World and in a subsequent book called Ten Days in a Mad-House. These two landmark publications prompted a court case and an official visit to Blackwell's Island, which led to several nurses being fired and various doctors being replaced.</p><p>In the early 20th century, the island became known as "Welfare Island" as the city had started to build its hospitals and prisons there.</p><p>The Smallpox Hospital moved to North Brothers Island in the 1950s, and Roosevelt Island became increasingly populated. It's been entirely abandoned ever since and only became a protected site by the NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1976. Its derelict facade remains standing to this day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyirsCnm6imlZl6qbvSqaCtmZyofHU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1349900-ccw-announces-rebirth-of-championship-wrestling-from-florida.html><span>←</span><span>CCW Announces Rebirth Of Championship Wrestling From Florida</span></a>
