According to <a href=#>Biography</a>,&nbsp;Ball's father, Henry Durrell Ball, an electrician by trade, fell ill with typhoid when she was a small child, barely 4 years old. In her memoir, "Love, Lucy," Ball recounts her mother telling her about her father's death as one of her earliest and most difficult memories (via <a href=#>Cheatsheet</a>).</p><p dir=ltr>"And I remember at that very moment, a picture suddenly fell from the wall." Ball writes in her memoir, "And I noticed on the kitchen windowsill some little gray sparrows feeding. I've been superstitious about birds ever since. I've heard that birds flying in the window are supposed to bring bad luck." Ball, heard right. The <a href=#>Bird Spot</a> claims that a variation of this superstition exists across a variety of cultures. Some people believe that a black bird flying into the home could mean the death of a family member has occurred or will occur soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCDkXJvcWhfrLW6ecuumqKknJp6o63LpWSwmaNiwLa8xKuqraGknry2v4yamaitpGK9qq%2FTrqmeq12ks26uyKubrGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-kevins-future-wife-on-this-is-us-everything-we-know.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Kevins Future Wife on This Is Us?
