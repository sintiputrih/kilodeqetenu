Although Dr. Seuss’ The Grinch — both the cartoon and the live-action version — is a family favorite over the holiday season, not all fans were interested in NBC’s production of Dr. Seuss’ The Grinch Musical!</p><p><a href=#><strong>Matthew Morrison</strong></a>, best known for his role as Will Schuester on <a href=#>Glee</a>, took on the role of the green humbug in the musical, which aired on Wednesday, December 9. The grinch’s dog was portrayed by two actors — <a href=#><strong>Booboo Stewart</strong></a> played young Max while American Horror Story vet <strong>Denis O’Hare</strong> played the older version.</p><p>From the moment the production began, viewers took to social media to share their opinions.

Morrison’s 3-year-old son Revel, <a href=#>whom he shares with wife <strong>Renee Morrison</strong></a>, was also a bit disturbed.</p><p>“He was a little scared at first. Like, when he saw me in full makeup and everything,” the Broadway star, 42, <a href=#>said on Daily Pop!</a> on Wednesday. “[We] kind of eased him into it. We kind of made it into, honestly, a game going into this whole experience, and very teachable moments. We would wake up, for a lesson to brush our teeth, you know, ‘Oh Rev, you’ve got some Grinchy breath this morning.’ And then, he’d go brush his teeth.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Part of the reason that some found the portrayal so disturbing? The dancing, which Morrison did on purpose.</p><p>“I didn’t want the Grinch to be a good dancer,” he told <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a> before the special. “I took a lot from <a href=#><strong>Joaquin Phoenix</strong></a>‘s performance in Joker.”</p><p>Scroll through the gallery for more reactions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BirrXAx56uZqWfp7%2Bqv86nqmadlae2pnnGq6Cnm5hiwbOtzaydqKqdlsGqu81mm6KrpKq%2Fo7%2BMn5inq18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./category.html><span>←</span><span>KEYTALK | ROCK NOTE</span></a>
