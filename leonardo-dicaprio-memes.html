Here are the best memes to commemorate the breakup.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Leonardo DiCaprio has been acting since he was around 5, but it wasn't until his critically acclaimed performances in 1993's What's Eating Gilbert Grape and 1995's Basketball Diaries that he cemented himself as a mainstay in the public eye. And once he received commercial success with the behemoth that was Titanic, there was nothing stopping Leo from becoming one of the world's biggest superstars. And not only that, but he became one of the world's biggest heartthrobs. <a href=#>The '90s</a> were nothing without horny teens plastering posters of Leo on their bedroom walls.</p><p>Being one of the world's most enduring Hollywood heartthrobs, <a href=#>Leonardo DiCaprio</a> is aging like God herself intended, but his dating pool hilariously stays the same age. Hmm, we certainly have some thoughts about that. Leo has seemingly followed a pattern with his dating life, and we've dug up some of the best Twitter <a href=#>memes</a> to poke fun at all the tea.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">After Leonardo DiCaprio and girlfriend Camila Morrone broke up after four years, fans joked that it followed his pattern of not dating anyone over age 25.</h2><p>Believe it or not, Leonardo first met his now-ex when she was just 10 years old and her former stepdad, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Al Pacino, introduced the two</a>. We know, kind of creepy. Now that she's a 25-year-old woman with a fully developed brain, the pair have officially split after four trips around the sun together.</p><p>Whether it was him dating Gisele Bündchen for five years starting when she was just 18, or his five-year fling with Bar Refaeli that also ended when she hit the Big 25, Leo seems to only date ladies in their early-to-mid 20s. Blake Lively, Erin Heatherton, Nina Agdal, and the list goes on.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>To commemorate Leo's split from Camila Morrone, the internet had a blast posting memes left and right about the age gap pattern.</p><p>Here are some of the best ones.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">"The stats are breathtaking."</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>there's no phenomenon on this planet more reliable than leonardo dicaprio breaking up with his girl by age 25, the stats are breathtaking <a href=#>https://t.co/A9czRJo56Q</a></p>— no (@zedonarrival) <a href=#>August 30, 2022</a></figure><p>We have to commend the consistency, if we're being honest. Consistency is key to any successful relationship ... right?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">It's for the sake of America.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>maybe leonardo dicaprio hated 9/11 so much that he can’t even date women who remember it. did that even occur to you</p>— Sarah Lazarus (@sarahclazarus) <a href=#>August 30, 2022</a></figure><p>Please, this one is borderline problematic, but not enough to stop us from laughing at the absurdity. Where were Leo's exes when 9/11 happened? They were barely old enough to hold onto their pacifiers without drooling up a storm.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">We love math!</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This Leonardo DiCaprio graph where he continues to get older and his girlfriends never age above 25 lives rent-free in my head. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/bHlhw7Evmg</a></p>— Sarah Lerner (@SarahLerner) <a href=#>August 31, 2022</a></figure><p>The amount of effort that went into this meme is impressive. Though the graph itself needs some updating! Camilla did make it to the 25 mark before getting the ax, after all.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Cue the 'Hannah Montana' scene segue vocals.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Leonardo DiCaprio once his girlfriend’s brain finishes development <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/IdpkZFE3uk</a></p>— mrs knightley (@sotrulybeloved) <a href=#>August 30, 2022</a></figure><p>Leo knew the time would come, the time each of his girlfriends would reach the wrinkly, decrepit old age of 25. He'll at least remember them fondly, blowing a kiss goodbye to each one every time the clock strikes 25.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Bye, girl!</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Leonardo Dicaprio when his girlfriends reach 25 years of age <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/4KOiUbIb5U</a></p>— Stop Inventing S'V (@DayaJolieME) <a href=#>August 30, 2022</a></figure><p>It's truly the Twilight reference for us. How is it that a clip of Dakota Fanning as Volturi member Jane throwing an immortal baby into a fire can be used for so many situations? We don't know, but we love it.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Sing it, Lana.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>“will you still love me when i’m no longer young and beautiful?”</p><p>leonardo dicaprio: <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/JdXHLMnpCm</a></p>— taylor (@lillactk) <a href=#>August 30, 2022</a></figure><p>Though we appreciate the Lana Del Rey reference, we must point out that the rest of the song does not apply. "I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will." Heck, likely none of Leo's girlfriends felt that kind of confidence in their relationships. It's more like "I know you won't."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ba dum tss!</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>titanic turns 25 this year at which point i assume leonardo dicaprio will no longer want to be in it</p>— Tom Neenan (@TNeenan) <a href=#>August 31, 2022</a></figure><p>A sex joke blended with a Titanic joke is surely one that deserves to stay afloat.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfobKwusCrm6hllJ6worzRoqZmpZWisrQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./natasha-nice-net-worth-67737.html><span>←</span><span>Natasha Nice Net Worth</span></a>
