The trial was heard on November 14 at the Seoul Central District Court’s 23rd Criminal Agreement Division. The prosecution has asked for three years in prison for the South Korean music executive and two years in prison for the BTBT vocalist.</p><p>According to the prosecution, the former YG Entertainment boss intimidated ex-idol trainee Han Seo-hee after she told police about B.I’s suspected drug usage.&nbsp;“He clearly persuaded the former trainee informant by telling him it was nothing to take someone like you out. His unlawful behavior was malicious, and he seems to be without remorse.”&nbsp;Yang Hyun-suk also attempted to cover up the situation in other ways, which exacerbated his crime.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Yang Hyun Suk’s closing statements after prosecutors request a 3-year jail term</p><p>“Currently, K-pop singers are<br>expanding around the world and raising Korea’s status with great popularity,” he said. “Please make a wise decision to help them with my small and insufficient power.” <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/A8Tzxn5Xvg</a></p><p>— Pratchetteer 🎋 (@manonaswann) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">November 14, 2022</a></p><h2>Yang Hyun-suk, the former CEO of YG Entertainment, was accused of threatening and coercing Han Seo-hee.</h2><p>During the current trial, the prosecution sought a three-year jail term for Yang Hyun-suk. After revealing information on B.I’s unlawful drug usage, the former K-pop star was charged with blackmailing and threatening Han Seo-hee with death.&nbsp;Prosecutors also stated that Yang showed no remorse for his acts.</p><p>The former Seo Taiji and Boys member acknowledged speaking with Han Seo-hee. In a statement, he, however, refuted the charges of coercion and threats.</p><p>“The majority of the tales are false. I advised her to be a decent child, which meant she shouldn’t use drugs, and I told them this out of concern. The other half of the time was spent soothing and listening.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Yang-Hyun-suk-1.jpg alt width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Yang’s statements, according to the victim, were more incensed and menacing. He is said to have told Han Seo-hee:</p><p>“Everything you say in the inquiry is visible to me,” “It would be simple to murder someone like you in the entertainment industry,” “If you return your police statement, I’ll offer you a prize and select a lawyer for you.”</p><p>The court will issue the ultimate punishment in December.</p><h2>B.I had already received a three-year jail term</h2><p>Former iKON member B.I, the actual name Kim Han-bin, was involved in an illicit drug usage scandal in 2016, and Han Seo-hee (then known as informant ‘A’) told authorities that she gave marijuana to an iKON member.&nbsp;However, she quickly refuted the information and retracted her first remark. Han Seo-hee returned three years later, asserting the same claims and accusing Yang Hyun-suk of evading the charges. The creator of YG is now on trial and faces three years in jail.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Yang-Hyun-suk-2.jpg alt="Yang Hyun-suk" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>B.I was sentenced to three years in jail, suspended for four years, in September 2021. He was also sentenced to 40 hours of drug treatment and 80 hours of community service.&nbsp;Meanwhile, Han Seo-hee was sentenced to six months in prison for her third drug conviction in September 2022.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiwmqaXYrW6wc1mqq6jXZi8trjDZp2am5Viwam%2BxJ5ksp2Rp8Butc1mp6uho6S7brLOq2Scp6aav6q6xmanqWWSYra0ecOrrKBlk52us7PErGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brianna-burrell-bio-age-height-dating-job-miss-alabama.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Brianna Burrell?
