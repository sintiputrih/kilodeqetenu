co-founded the ill-fated Fyre Festival.</p><p>He defrauded investors of $27.4 million by marketing and selling tickets to the festival and other events.</p><p>In 2013, McFarland founded Magnises, a company that marketed an invitation-only charge card, using $1.5 million of investor funding.&nbsp;</p><p>As of January 2024, Billy McFarland’s net worth is approximately -$26 Million.&nbsp;</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=early-life></span>Early Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>William Z. “Billy” McFarland was born on the 11th of December, 1991, in Millburn, New Jersey.</p><p>His parents are real estate developers.&nbsp;</p><p>When Billy was 13 years old, he founded an online outsourcing startup that matched clients with web designers.</p><p>McFarland attended Bucknell University in Lewisburg where he studied computer engineering for less than 9 months.&nbsp;</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career></span>Career&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While he was once on his way to becoming one of the <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/top-20-richest-people-world/ data-lasso-id=143381 data-wpel-link=internal><u>richest people in the world</u></a>, Billy McFarland has since lost his entire fortune.&nbsp;</p><p>Although he’s in hot water now, not long ago he was one of the hottest up-and-coming entrepreneurs around thanks to his business skills.&nbsp;</p><p>When he was only 13 years old, he founded an online outsourcing startup that matched clients with web designers around the world.&nbsp;</p><p>After graduating from Pingry School in 2010, he attended Bucknell University but dropped out in May of his freshman year.&nbsp;</p><h3>From Dropout To Millionaire</h3><p>After dropping out of college, McFarland caused a stir by creating the online advertisement platform Spling, which he served as the CEO of.&nbsp;</p><p>Described as a content-sharing network, Spling was criticized for how similar it was to other available services at that time.&nbsp;</p><p>While Spling was a short-lived venture, McFarland didn’t stay down for long and bounced back with the company Magnises.&nbsp;</p><p>Hailed as NYC’s most exclusive credit card, Magnises was a “black card” that came with perks and club memberships in certain big cities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>While Magnises was one of the <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/most-exclusive-black-cards/ data-lasso-id=143382 data-wpel-link=internal><u>most exclusive black cards in the world</u></a> when it started, it has since been described as a scam.&nbsp;</p><p>Following McFarland’s Fyre Festival disaster, Magnises was shuttered, and its website stopped allowing new sign-ups.&nbsp;</p><h3>The Infamous Fyre Festival</h3><p>The Fyre Festival was founded by Billy McFarland and <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/ja-rule-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=143383 data-wpel-link=internal><u>Ja Rule</u></a> and it was set to take place in 2017 in the Bahamas.&nbsp;</p><p>McFarland heavily advertised the festival on Instagram and even enlisted the likes of <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/kendall-jenner-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=143384 data-wpel-link=internal><u>Kendall Jenner</u></a> and <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/bella-hadid-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=143385 data-wpel-link=internal><u>Bella Hadid</u></a> to help promote it.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, during the first weekend of the festival, there were issues with almost everything, including food, accommodation, security, and medical services.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of the gourmet meals and luxury villas, the attendees had paid for, they were given pre-packaged sandwiches and shoddy tents.&nbsp;</p><p>Because of this, the festival ended up being indefinitely postponed, though due to its high profile, it was immediately met with scrutiny.&nbsp;</p><h3>The Lies Come Out</h3><p>Although guests were promised luxury accommodations and performances from artists like <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/lil-yachty-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=143386 data-wpel-link=internal><u>Lil Yachty</u></a> and <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/migos-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=143387 data-wpel-link=internal><u>Migos</u></a>, that was far from what they got.&nbsp;</p><p>After the festival was indefinitely postponed, it was revealed that McFarland had borrowed roughly $7 million for funding.</p><p>One such loan was for $3 million, and it required McFarland to repay at least $500k within 16 days of taking it out.&nbsp;</p><p>In an attempt to repay the loan, McFarland emailed attendees suggesting they deposit between $300 to $500 for everyday they planned to attend.&nbsp;</p><p>According to a lawsuit, this raised roughly $2 million for festival goes and went towards paying off his short-term loan.&nbsp;</p><p>Billy McFarland and Ja Rule were <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://variety.com/2017/music/news/fyre-festival-mark-geragos-lawsuit-1202404487/ data-lasso-id=143388 data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer"><u>sued for $100 million</u></a> in 2017 for leaving attendees stranded in the Bahamas without basic provisions.&nbsp;</p><h3>Law And Order</h3><p>Along with the first&nbsp;lawsuit, another class-action suit was filed in May 2017, along with 6 federal and 4 individual lawsuits.&nbsp;</p><p>McFarland was then arrested by federal agents and charged with wire fraud, with the possibility of 4 years and 9 months in jail.&nbsp;</p><p>While he was out on bail, he continued committing fraud with a NYC VIP Access scheme, selling tickets to unavailable events.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2018, he pleaded guilty to 2 counts of wire fraud and agreed to forfeit $26 million that investors had put into his company.&nbsp;</p><p>The same year, he was sentenced to six years in federal prison, and he was released in March 2022 with his house arrest ending in September.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>His story was covered in one of the <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/best-netflix-documentaries/ data-lasso-id=143389 data-wpel-link=internal><u>best documentaries on Netflix</u></a>, Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened.&nbsp;</p><p>However, in April 2023 he announced on Twitter that Fyre Festival II was happening, so he may not have learned his lesson.&nbsp;</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section
