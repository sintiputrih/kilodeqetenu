However, Constantine headed to the throne at a time of great political unrest and his appointment of Georgios Athanasiadis-Novas as Prime Minister of Greece in 1965 following the resignation of Georgios Papandreou led to protests on the streets, which were only resolved by the 1967 elections.</p><p id=e9DEShaWa2i data-wc=59>In 1967, a military coup was launched leading to the formation of a new government, which was sworn in by Constantine. However, the Greek monarch <strong>organised a counter-coup months later, which ultimately failed, leading to the royal family fleeing Greece</strong>. Constantine was still King of Greece for six years until the junta abolished the monarchy on 1 June 1973.</p><p id=erYHhuVzIFu data-wc=52>When the junta fell the following a year, a referendum was held on restoring the monarchy, however, the Greek public voted resoundingly against this.
