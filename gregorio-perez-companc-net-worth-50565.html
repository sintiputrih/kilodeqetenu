He was adopted in 1945 by <a href=#>Margarita</a> Companc de P√©rez Acu√±a, a local socialite, and enrolled at the La Salle college preparatory school, though he left before graduating. He married Maria del Carmen "Munchi" Sundblad Beccar Varela, an heiress, in 1964, and in 1968, was named <a href=#>Director</a> of the Banco R√≠o de La Plata (at the time of the country's largest, private-sector banks), following its purchase by his family. He built much of his fortune, however, as head of Petrolera P√©rez Companc, a family-based conglomerate in oil and gas that was first established by Gregorio's adoptive <a href=#>Father</a> in 1946.</p><span>1993</span><p>P√©rez Companc purchased a controlling stake in Banco R√≠o de la Plata from his siblings in 1993, and would sell his shares to <a href=#>Spanish</a> banking giant Banco Santander in 1997. Between 1990 and 1994, the company expanded its domestic activities in the oil <a href=#>Business</a> and in a number of other industries through participation in the country's privatization programme initiated by <a href=#>President</a> <a href=#>Carlos Menem</a>. By 1996, P√©rez Companc S.A. had consolidated sales of US$1.41 billion. The family strengthened its hand in 1998 by forming a new public holding company, PC Holdings S.A., and later that year, acquired a 68% share in local food giant Molinos R√≠o de la Plata from the traditional agribusiness house, Bunge y Born, for US$380 million. Molinos R√≠o de la Plata, which sells Luchetti's pasta, Cocinero oils and Nobleza Gaucha yerba mate (among numerous brands), is one of Argentina's leading processed foods companies, earning roughly US$850 million in revenues in 2009.</p><span>1999</span><p>In 1999, shareholders in P√©rez Companc S.A. exchanged their voting shares for nonvoting shares (Class B shares) in PC Holdings S.A.: this raised some concern from financial and political analyst, since in such a transaction the controlling shareholders would have multiple vote shares to ensure their continuing voting control. However, the Comision Nacional de Valores approved the exchange, thus allowing the P√©rez Companc family to own 58% of the company with 80% voting control. The <a href=#>Argentine</a> economic crisis produced numerous problems for the country's <a href=#>Energy</a> sector, and 1999 revenues for Petrolera P√©rez Companc declined 3% to US$1.27 billion. The family also sold their 19% stake in Banco R√≠o de la Plata during 1999. In a year that saw the <a href=#>Argentine</a> economy shaken by the worst economic turmoil in over a century, P√©rez Companc continued to oversee growth in the family's <a href=#>Business</a> concerns: the value of the group's consolidated <a href=#>Energy</a>, food processing and financial services portfolio grew a healthy 20% during 2001.</p><span>2002</span><p>He scored a big coup in October 2002 when he announced the sale of the family's 60% share of Petrolera P√©rez Companc to <a href=#>Brazilian</a> oil giant Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. (Petrobras) for a reported US$1 billion in cash and bonds.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.idolnetworth.com/images/play_game.png alt="More or less Game" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <a href=# class=btn>Play Game</a><h2>Tags:</h2><a href=#>1934 births</a> <a href=#>Living people</a> <a href=#>Argentine businesspeople</a> <a href=#>Argentine people of Spanish descent</a> <a href=#>People from Buenos Aires</a> <a href=#>Argentine Roman Catholics</a> <a href=#>Argentine billionaires</a> <a href=#>Adoptees</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeXp7Kou9Gipmaolaeyu3nCqKSpmZ6Yeq%2Bx02auqKqknXp2fJRvbA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./danny-trejo-height.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Danny Trejo Height How Tall is the Tough Guy Actor?</span></a>
