Elizabeth and JonBenét’s father John Bennett Ramsey was the one who discovered JonBenét’s body in the basement of their house.</p><p>JonBenét’s body was found on December 26, 1996, after she had been reported missing. A handwritten ransom note was found. The note was reportedly a two-and-a-half-page. The ransom note was found on the kitchen staircase at the Ramsey family’s Boulder residence. The note demanded US$118,000 (equivalent to $203,877 in 2021). The ransom note was unusually long. The ransom note read;</p><p>Mr. Ramsey,</p><p>Listen carefully! We are a group of individuals that represent a small foreign faction. We do respect your bussiness but not the country that it serves. At this time we have your daughter in our posession. She is safe and unharmed and if you want her to see 1997, you must follow our instructions to the letter.</p><p>You will withdraw $118,000.00 from your account. $100,000 will be in $100 bills and the remaining $18,000 in $20 bills. Make sure that you bring an adequate size attache to the bank. When you get home you will put the money in a brown paper bag. I will call you between 8 and 10 am tomorrow to instruct you on delivery. The delivery will be exhausting so I advise you to be rested. If we monitor you getting the money early, we might call you early to arrange an earlier delivery of the money and hence a earlier delivery pick-up of your daughter.</p><p>Any deviation of my instructions will result in the immediate execution of your daughter. You will also be denied her remains for proper burial. The two gentlemen watching over your daughter do not particularly like you so I advise you not to provoke them. Speaking to anyone about your situation, such as Police, F.B.I., etc., will result in your daughter being beheaded.</p><p>If we catch you talking to a stray dog, she dies. If you alert bank authorities, she dies. If the money is in any way marked or tampered with, she dies. You will be scanned for electronic devices and if any are found, she dies. You can try to deceive us but be warned that we are familiar with law enforcement countermeasures and tactics.</p><p>You stand a 99% chance of killing your daughter if you try to out smart us. Follow our instructions and you stand a 100% chance of getting her back. You and your family are under constant scrutiny as well as the authorities. Don’t try to grow a brain John. You are not the only fat cat around so don’t think that killing will be difficult. Don’t underestimate us John. Use that good southern common sense of yours. It is up to you now John!</p><p>Victory!</p><p>S.B.T.C</p><p>At the time JonBenét’s body was found, she had sustained a broken skull from a blow to the head and had been strangled. A garrote was found tied around her neck. The autopsy report stated that JonBenét’s official cause of death was “asphyxia by strangulation associated with craniocerebral trauma” and her death was ruled a homicide.</p><p><strong>Also Read: </strong><a href=#>Kris Murrell: Age, Career, Movies, Relationship & More</a></p><p>The case generated worldwide public and media interest, in part because her mother Patsy Ramsey, a former beauty queen, had entered JonBenét into a series of child beauty pageants. The crime is still considered a cold case and remains an open investigation with the Boulder Police Department.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Elizabeth Pasch Ramsey Was Killed In A Car Accident</h2><p>Elizabeth Pasch Ramsey passed away after she was involved in a car crash.
