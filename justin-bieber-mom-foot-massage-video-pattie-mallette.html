As we previously told you, Pattie has been stuck in a wheelchair the last couple of days, as she unfortunately broke her foot during their mother-son vacation. And now, it looks like Justin has been trying to comfort her… starting with a foot massage. Pattie took to Instagram on Jan. 22, where she posted a “story” video of Justin giving her a massage. “You’re not a doctor, don’t touch it!” she joked with a caption. Then she pretended he responded back by saying, “I care! Ouch.” And then she asked her followers if she should trust Justin or not — LOL!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><strong>Related</strong>: <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Best Foot Massagers</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>It seems like a sweet thing for Justin to do, but Twitter isn’t a huge fan of this massage. Some fans have said it’s pretty weird for a son to massage his mom’s foot, but we’ll refrain from making a judgement. Instead, we’ll just show you what Justin’s fans have been saying about the new video. “Am I the only one who thinks Justin Bieber and his mom are TOO touchy feely with eachother??🤔🤔🤔 and TOO close??” is what one Twitter user asked. Others asked similar questions. There were also a few people who said things like “yikes”, “it’s weird” and <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>more on this forum</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Fortunately for Justin, though, a lot of people found the video to be cute. For instance, take a look at the tweet below with the video and a caption saying, “This is not funny but look at this laugh omg I cant I’m laughing so much @justinbieber your laugh is everything and stop hurting your mom ❤️😂❤️😂 Get better @pattiemallette.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>This is not funny but look at this laugh omg I cant I’m laughing so much <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@justinbieber</a> your laugh is everything and stop hurting your mom ❤️😂❤️😂<br>Get better <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@pattiemallette</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/wnuZSqURyK</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>— mari (@icyfuls) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>January 22, 2018</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, how do YOU feel about Justin Bieber giving his mom a foot massage?
