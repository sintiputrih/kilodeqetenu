I was really into community gardening at the time, and I began volunteering to teach people from low-income communities how to grow their own food.</p><p>“Through gardening, I learned a little bit about biology and chemistry, enough to realise I wanted to delve more into science. I went back to school to study biochemistry, which led me to medicine. I liked osteopathic medicine’s focus on helping the whole patient, and I was interested in learning manual techniques to help patients.”</p><p><i>This article was originally published on July 24, 2023</i></p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS6osDIpZuaZaOprrN5yaKkprFdoK6zxtJmpZ6vXaG8sLeMmp2tnaJivra1062gp59dnbytuNiwpqicXZeypLvMoqWgZZSksLW70WiNfYR1eYCZgqSPemuEd4Sfl5qljHiHgWd4mnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-adam-woronowicz-wife-agnieszka-woronowicz.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Adam Woronowicz Wife Agnieszka Woronowicz?
