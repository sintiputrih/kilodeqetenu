Different salamander species have different life cycles, too. Some breed, lay their eggs, and hatch on land while others, such as some of the newts, breed and lay eggs in the water. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on animals.sandiegozoo.org</a><h2>How to Care for Salamanders</h2><h2>What to do if you find salamander eggs?</h2>If you find spotted salamander eggs or salamander. larvae, you are welcome to look at them, but please. don't collect them or remove them from the vernal pool, because they depend on these habitats to survive. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on facebook.com</a><h2>Where do salamanders lay their eggs?</h2>They deposit their eggs in moist, protected subterranean sites, such as cracks in rock rubble or talus slopes.

They also are careful to choose the right place to lay their eggs. After they lay their eggs, they leave the pond and don't provide any more care for their offspring. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on biokids.umich.edu</a><h2>Should salamanders be in water?</h2>Most (if not all) salamanders are only semi-aquatic, so you would want the tank to have both land and water areas, with easy access to go between the two. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on quora.com</a><h2>What does salamander larvae look like?</h2>The salamander larvae are smaller versions of adults, although they differ from their adult counterparts by the presence of external gills, a tailfin, distinctive larval dentition, a rudimentary tongue, and the absence of eyelids. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on britannica.com</a><h2>What salamander stays in water?</h2>The axolotl (ACK-suh-LAH-tuhl) is the Peter Pan of salamanders.
