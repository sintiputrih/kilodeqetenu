Christine Perfect joined the band in 1968 as a session player on keyboards and backing vocals. She married John McVie that year and became a permanent member of the band in 1969. Green's use of psychedelic drugs and mounting tensions within the group ended with his exiting the band in 1970. He wasn't alone.</p><p>Jeremy Spencer literally departed from the band the next year. He wandered off with no word and joined a cult, the <a href=#>Children of</a> <a href=#>God</a>, just hours before Fleetwood Mac was set to perform a sold-out show at LA's famed Whiskey A Go Go. Green returned to help finish out the band's American tour and then departed having once again been a member of Fleetwood Mac for all of six weeks. From there, the changes came fast and often.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kW1namtkZLqqr8pmnaWdlanEsLvDZpinnF2fvKm6jKaar6GVYsGpsYyopaWxXWd6pLvNrKuapqSoerCyjJ%2Bjnp2krLywsIymmJxn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./reno-wilson.html><span>←</span><span>Reno Wilson - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Married,Facts</span></a>
