The film is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rated the worst in the franchise</a>, annoyed legions of fans and may have done some serious damage to the reputation of the series. Since its release though, folks have been wondering just what went wrong and a hint came early in 2020 when gossip started to leak about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tensions between director J.J. Abrams and Lucasfilm</a>.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=193 data-current-count=193 data-injectable=false>The story goes that Abrams screened a cut that came in somewhere around the three-hour mark, only to be ordered to slice it down substantially. This resulted in a theatrical cut of 122 minutes.</p><p data-characters=448 data-current-count=641 data-injectable=true>That paring down means a lot has been left on the cutting room floor. We’ve seen evidence of many of these cut scenes in behind-the-scenes pictures and sources from within the production, too. This has included scenes of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kylo Ren reassembling his shattered helmet</a>, the ‘Jedi chorus’ in the film’s finale featuring <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ghosts rather than just voices</a> and now, a scene in which Kylo Ren apparently ponders Vader’s burnt mask.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/renvader-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/renvader-4.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/renvader-3-e1659489247275.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/renvader-2.jpg><p data-characters=409 data-current-count=409 data-injectable=true>The above stills are from The Skywalker Legacy, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">feature-length documentary included with the home release</a> of The Rise of Skywalker.&nbsp;Though the scene is clearly unfinished (you can see a blue screen in the corner), it looks like it’d have provided a quieter and contemplative moment. And honestly, the movie is sorely lacking those, racing at full speed through locations without pausing for breath.</p><p data-characters=276 data-current-count=276 data-injectable=false>It also appears that this would have given us some more perspective on Kylo Ren. His complicated relationship with his family legacy is at the core of his character, and at least to my eyes, this looks like he’s wondering if he’ll soon meet the same fate as Vader.</p><p data-characters=146 data-current-count=422 data-injectable=false>Maybe one day we’ll get a director’s cut of <strong>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</strong>, but I wouldn’t count on it happening anytime soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoqq2ZomLEor7SZqmiq5ViwKzF1pqjpJ2iYrGmuMStnJ1lo5iyr7GMrJ%2Bor6NiuLq4zmapnqZdpbyvsMSroKefXZmus8DHZq2anJWnwG60xKWknqxf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./oak-run-public-golf-course.html><span>←</span><span>Oak Run Public Golf Course</span></a>
