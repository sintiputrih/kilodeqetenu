In a 2019 interview with <a href=#>People</a>, Angela Bassett said that the then-13-year-old had become so passionate about rap that he was asking her to use her deep pockets and connections to find him a studio where he could record some of his original songs. Two years later, he was still honing his skills. "At 15, he just wants to work on his music," Bassett told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> in 2021. "He likes to write lyrics and rap, so he's all in on that."</p><p>Vance clearly inherited his parents' drive. In 2021, he dropped his first record, "Journey 2 Forever." Slater then got right back in the studio to record the EP "Holehearted."</p><p>As many musicians have learned, using social media can be an effective way to promote their work and gain a fan following. But it has its pitfalls. Slater learned this the hard way when he decided to participate in a TikTok challenge that calls for kids to record themselves lying to their parents about a celebrity dying. Slater chose Bassett's "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever" co-star Michael B. Jordan. Unsurprisingly, his prank did not go over well at all, and he issued an emotional apology in a since-deleted video. Luckily, his mom is the forgiving type. "We all make mistakes, own up to them, take responsibility. And then hold your head up and move forward," Bassett told <a href=#>ET</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampka4Rzgo6apaCdnJZ6o63SrJytrKNiwbi1zaxksKCRqXq4sYykpaivXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-disease-does-sam-have-in-the-last-of-us.html><span>←</span><span>What disease does Sam have in The Last of Us?</span></a>
