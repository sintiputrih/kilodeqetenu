Fisher shot Buttafuoco’s wife, Mary Jo, in the face in May 1992 after confronting her about the affair.</p><p>After Mary Jo identified Fisher as the assailant, an investigation was launched, and Buttafuoco was indicted on 19 counts of statutory rape, sodomy, and endangering the welfare of a child. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six months in jail. He also had other run-ins with the law, including charges of solicitation of prostitution and insurance fraud.</p><p>Despite his legal troubles, Buttafuoco remained married to Mary Jo during his jail time. They eventually moved to California, where they stayed together for almost a decade before Mary Jo filed for divorce in 2003. Buttafuoco later married Evanka Franjko in 2005, but the couple went through a brief divorce before reconciling.</p><p>Despite his controversial past, Buttafuoco remains a public figure and has continued to make appearances in the media.</p><h2><span id=Joey_Buttafuocos_Rise_to_Minor_Celebrity_Status>Joey Buttafuoco’s Rise to Minor Celebrity Status</span></h2><p>Following the Fisher shooting trial, Buttafuoco became a minor celebrity due to the massive amount of media coverage surrounding the trial.

Two years later, in 2009, Mary Jo released a book that told the story of the shooting and her decision to remain married to Buttafuoco from her perspective.</p><p>In the same year, Buttafuoco appeared on an episode of “Judge Pirro” and was successful in his attempt to sue an adult film actress for failing to pay an auto body bill.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunC2zp6wZpqlqcGistSomqhlnprBbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./aaa-membership-discounts-seniors.html><span>←</span><span>AAA Offers Membership Discounts for Seniors: Save Big!</span></a>
