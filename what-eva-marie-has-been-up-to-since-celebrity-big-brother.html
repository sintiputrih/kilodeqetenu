Reality TV fans spotted the former <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Total Divas</a> star on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Big Brother</a>, she had some serious competition skills though ultimately, Marie fell short of the grand prize.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Former Big Brother Winner Derrick Levasseur Is Impressed With An All-Stars’ Gameplay And It Isn’t Cody</a></span></p><h2 id=the-celebrity-bb-gig-opened-doors>The 'Celebrity BB' Gig Opened Doors</h2><p>She’s appearing in lots of film and television since Celebrity Big Brother, most notably, she recently took part in an action flick alongside Bruce Willis, Hard Kill. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">It was a different process for Eva,</a> as not only did she change hair color, but she wasn’t used to all the props, such as the heavy firearms;</p><p>“It’s so heavy, everything that you’re wearing,” she recalled. “It is extensive gear that is stacked up. Not only that but if you’re in the heat or you’re in the desert, all of that plays into how you are able to hold your weapon and using your weapons correctly. A lot of times in these action films, you see there’s so much ease with the weaponry when in actuality it’s heavy.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only is she appearing in films, but she’s also very active on social media, with various endorsement deals, particularly in the fitness space - she’s seriously ripped, some things just never change!</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED –<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Big Brother’s Nicole Anthony Already Has Regrets From The All-Star Season</a></span></p><h2 id=is-a-wwe-return-on-the-horizon>Is A WWE Return on The Horizon?</h2><p>As for WWE, Eva always credits the company for preparing her, especially in the world of Hollywood. She’s impressed with the current product and how the women’s division continues to evolve, a surprise to few, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eva’s more than open to a WWE return</a> if the timing and plotline are both on point;</p><p>“WWE is my No. 1. My home. My family. They prepared me for all the things I am doing and what I want to do in my career. I am forever grateful to the company, to Vince [McMahon], Hunter [Triple H] and Stephanie [McMahon]. If it made sense, of course I’d come back home.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The question remains, will WWE ask for Marie back at any point? She was a polarizing figure with the audience, receiving jeers throughout her career.</p><p>It would be quite the talking point if a return were to take place, we can picture a one-time only scenario taking place during a special match, like at the Royal Rumble.</p><p>At least we know she’s open to it.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT –<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Demi Burnett Says WWE Star Angel Garza Leaving Her Alone Was ‘Intense’</a></span></p><p>Sources – 411 Mania & Yahoo</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrK3rYymmKuhlWK1or%2BMm5yepl2qvW7AzmaqoqaTmnqkscuemauhpK56o7XGZpmrp6SdsrN7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./705969-pele-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Pele Net Worth 2023: What Is The Soccer Legend Worth?</span></a>
