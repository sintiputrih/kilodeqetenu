For me, this is nothing to do with politics, it is simply my own medical concerns.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>While Druker said: ‘No one was willing to put their foot down, but thank god my mom is whoever she is. So, with her help, I was able to put the foot down and find many other people similar to me who are tired of it and want to take a stand,’ according to ABC San Francisco.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In October 2017, Druker made the news that he was bullied while a student at Palo Alto High School after wearing a Make America Great Again hat to class, reports Palo Alto Online.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He said that one student told him: ‘I literally want to shoot you right now if you don’t take off that hat.’ Druker, who identifies as a conservative politically, said that he wore the hat in an experiment regarding tolerance.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When pair launched their lawsuit, Glen told KTVU in an interview that the pair are not ‘anti-vaxers’ nor are they politically far-right.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She said: ‘We’re at school. We’re learning. We’re trying to pass chemistry, and be with our friends, and have fun. And make mistakes. And instead we’re having to worry about the validity and our college careers being put in jeopardy.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Druker and Glenn’s lawsuit is backed by Robert F.
