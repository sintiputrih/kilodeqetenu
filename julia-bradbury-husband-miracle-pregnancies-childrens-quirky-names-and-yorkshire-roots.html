At the time of her son’s birth, Julia said her pregnancy was a ‘miracle’ after her endometriosis diagnosis.</p><p>She told the Daily Mail: “We didn’t think it would be possible and the pregnancy has been a wonderful surprise for both of us. have endometriosis and honestly wasn’t sure if I would ever realise my ambition to be a mum so to fall pregnant feels like a bit of a miracle.”</p><p>In September 2014, the family announced they were expecting again, this time with twins conceived via IVF.

I love coming back. It makes my heart beat a little bit faster.” Speaking of her career venturing into the outdoor, she told the magazine: ‘It’s all about finding that balance for me.</p><p>“When I was about six years old, I started walking with my dad right on the doorstep of Sheffield and it continued into my teenage years. I loved having the contrast of inner-city life in Sheffield and exploring with my dad, and that quality time we had together in the Peak District instilled a love for the outdoors in me.’</p><p>She is Vice-President of South Yorkshire’s The Countryside Charity and in 2013 was awarded an honorary doctorate by Sheffield Hallam University.</p><p>Amazon Prime has thousands of original series, sport documentaries and films you can subscribe to watch here for just £7.99/ month plus a free month trial included.</p><p>Disney+ is here in the UK and if paid for an annual subscription can save viewers 15%, giving you access to Disney and Pixar films, and popular series such as The Mandalorian.
