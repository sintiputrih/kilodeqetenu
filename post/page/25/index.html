[Intro]
(Ah)
[Verse 1]
Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
And good for you, I guess that you’ve been workin’ on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand new girl</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Microsoft Demos Windows 7 on an Eee PC, it works - CES 2009</h2><time>Aug 30, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../show.html></a>
Microsoft was on-hand to not only pledge support for ASUS, but also demonstrate Windows 7 running on an Eee PC with 1GB of memory. The demo ran quickly, it was a simple Windows Live Messenger test, but the OS seemed quick at least. The Microsoft rep also demonstrated Windows 7’s fast sleep and resume times. Putting the Eee PC to sleep happened instantaneously, but waking it up took noticeably longer. Without a side by side comparison to Vista I couldn’t tell if Windows 7 was any faster in resume time, but it’s nice to see Microsoft taking memory and CPU power constrained systems into account when looking at Windows 7 performance.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Roasted Broccoli</h2><time>Aug 30, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../recipe-index-root.html></a>
Do you have any favorite broccoli recipes? I love it in just about anything – broccoli salad, frittatas, pasta, etc. – but my favorite way to eat broccoli might be the simplest: roasted! Roasted broccoli is so easy to make, and the florets come out of the oven deliciously golden brown, crisp, and tender. I have a hard time not eating them all straight off the sheet pan, but they’re also a fantastic addition to all sorts of recipes and a yummy side dish on their own.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Shania Twain to Reclaim Her Crown With Queen of Me</h2><time>Aug 30, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../shania-twain-tour-new-album-queen-of-me-html.html></a>
Let’s GO, gurls. You know her best as the queen of country pop, but let her reintroduce herself: She’s just the Queen of Me. Shania Twain, of course, is releasing her sixth album, Queen of Me, on February 3. It’s her first album since 2017’s Now, which itself ended a 15-year drought. But once again, the queen is back! Twain began her return last month with the glam-pop single “Waking Up Dreaming,” and follows that up today with “Last Day of Summer,” a more country-leaning cut that’s also a rare tearjerker from the usually lighthearted superstar.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../post/page/24/>← Prev Page</a>
