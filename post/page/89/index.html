There's a food goin' around
That's a sticky, sticky, goo
(Peanut, peanut butter)
A-well, it tastes real good
But it's so hard to chew
(Peanut, peanut butter)All my friends tell me
That they dig it the mo-ho-ost
(Peanut, peanut butter)
Early in the morning
When they spread it on to-oh-oast
(Peanut, peanut butter)
I like peanut butter
Creamy, peanut butter,
Chunky, peanut butter, too
