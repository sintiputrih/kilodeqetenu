<a href=../../../arm-unveils-bifrost-and-mali-g71.html></a>
Like ARM’s associated Cortex-A73 announcement, today’s Mali-G71 revelations are being made ahead of actual silicon availability. To that end a lot of ARM’s projections are based on early prototyping of manufacturing process and architectural simulations, though at this late stage those simulations tend to be pretty close.

Well, this is weird. On The X-Factor New Zealand (it’s everywhere!), two judges, married performers Natalia Kills and Willy Moon, have been accused of bullying a contestant on live TV and were swiftly fired from the show. You can see it all go down — Kills at first appears to be playfully teasing the contestant, which then turns into an all-out attack on his originality. It’s actually insane, and you mostly just have to watch it.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Brock Mikesell: YouTuber, Girlfriend, Career, and Net Worth</h2><time>Mar 12, 2024</time>

When I leave town, there are a few things that happen around my home. First of all, my husband orders all of his absolute favorites — meat lover’s pizza and chicken wings. A LOT of chicken wings. My boys can pound a ridiculous amount of chicken wings!
I just can’t do chicken wings. The hot wing sauce beckons me every single time but I can’t get past the chicken. &nbsp;So I figured out a way that I could still get my beloved hot wing sauce!</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Chicago White Sox Top Prospects, Rankings &amp;amp; Roster College Baseball, MLB Draft, Prospects</h2><time>Mar 12, 2024</time>

When I first started using tablets a few years back, I was generally in the “bigger is better” crowd – within limits of course. Basically, I liked the 10” form factor. As time has passed, I’ve started to gravitate towards a slightly smaller screen. Smartphones are still a bit too small for some things I do (hey, I’m getting old so staring at a 4-5” screen and reading text isn’t all that fun anymore), but carrying around a 10-inch tablet can be a bit cumbersome.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../post/page/136/>← Prev Page</a>
