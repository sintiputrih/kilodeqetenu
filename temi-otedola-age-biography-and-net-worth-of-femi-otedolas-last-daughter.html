<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Temi Otedola: Age, Biography and Net Worth of Femi Otedolas Last Daughter</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Temi Otedola (Full Name: Temiloluwa Elizabeth Otedola, born 20 March 1996) is a fast-rising Nigerian actress, blogger, and podcaster best known for starring in Citation (2020) and also for being the daughter of billionaire businessman Femi Otedola.</strong></p><p>The Otedola family of Lagos State is one of the most prominent families in Nigeria. Popular members of the family include the late Sir Michael Otedola (Governor of Lagos State from 1992 to 1993), billionaire businessman Femi Otedola, and Florence Ifeoluwa Otedola (aka DJ Cuppy). However, there are other members of the family to watch out for, including 26-year-old Temi.</p><p>Temi’s career is on the rise as she has accumulated a personal fortune of $2 million. She is widely talked about on social media due to her relationship with musician Mr. Eazi, the pioneer of Banku music. The duo has been dating for a few years now, and they run a joint podcast called How Far, where they talk about various issues, including their love life. Temi and Eazi are undoubtedly among Nigeria’s favorite celebrity couples, as people enjoy talking about them on Nigerian Twitter.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=profile-summary-of-temi-otedola></span><strong>Profile Summary of Temi Otedola</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li><strong>Full Name:</strong> Temiloluwa Elizabeth Otedola</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> 20 April 1996</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 26 years old</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> Nigerian</li><li><strong>Father:</strong> Femi Otedola</li><li><strong>Mother:</strong> Nana Otedola</li><li><strong>Siblings:</strong> 3</li><li><strong>Education:</strong> University of London</li><li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Actress, Blogger</li><li><strong>Net Worth:</strong> $2 Million</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=temi-otedola-was-born-into-an-affluent-family-26-years-ago></span><strong>Temi Otedola Was Born Into An Affluent Family 26 Years Ago</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Temi Otedola is from the Epe Local Government Area of Lagos State. She is the youngest daughter of Nana and Femi Otedola. Her father, Femi, is a billionaire businessman who made his wealth from dealings in the petroleum industry. He previously served as the chairman of Forte Oil PLC and is the founder of Zenon Petroleum and Gas Ltd.</p><p>Femi is not the first person in the Otedola family to enjoy success in their lives as his father, the late Sir Michael Otedola, was a politician who served as the former Governor of Lagos State, Nigeria. Sir Michael began his career as a teacher before working as a reporter and later sub-editor at newspapers in England like The Guardian and The Times. He later returned to Nigeria, where he became an Information Officer in the Western Nigeria government. He was then appointed the Editor of the Western Nigeria Illustrated and worked with Western Nigeria Television/Western Broadcasting Service and Mobil Oil Group of Companies.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=she-completed-her-education-in-london-england></span><strong>She Completed Her Education in London, England</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>There is conflicting information on the birthplace of Temi Otedola. While some reported she was born in Nigeria, others say she was born in London. Either way, it is no news that Otedola’s daughter spent much of her time in London, England, where she also completed her education. The schools where she completed her elementary and high school education are currently unknown. But after high school, she attended the prestigious University of London, where she acquired a Bachelor’s degree in Arts History.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=temi-started-a-fashion-blog-after-leaving-school></span><strong>Temi Started A Fashion Blog After Leaving School</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After completing her education, Temi began to live life in the spotlight. Her first move was to launch a fashion and style blog called JTO Fashion in 2014. On the platform, she showcases how she fuses African and Western styles; the fashion influencer also discusses her love for fashion, art, travel, and photography.</p><p>Temi Otedola has been quite successful with her blogging career as her blog earned her a nomination at the 2016 Nigerian Teen Choice Awards in the category of Choice Fashion Blogger. She has worked with several brands, locally and internationally, including Orange Culture Nigeria, FarFetch, and the Very UK.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=besides-blogging-temi-is-also-an-actress></span><strong>Besides Blogging, Temi is Also An Actress</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>For many years, Temi Otedola only concentrated on her blogging. There were no reports of her attending acting school or trying her hands at acting on a low-profile project. As a result, it came as a surprise to everyone when it was announced in 2020 that she would be making her acting debut in a big-budget movie by award-winning filmmaker Kunle Afolayan.</p><p>Temi featured alongside prominent actors and actresses like Jimmy Jean-Louis, Joke Silva, and Ini Edo, playing the role of Moremi Oluwa in Citation. The story revolves around Moremi, a high-flying student who accused a celebrated professor of sexual assault. However, she has to deal with a demoralizing tribunal, where the school authorities listen to testimony from Moremi, the accused, and other witnesses.</p><p>Although it was her acting debut, the actress put in an outstanding performance in the role and earned an award. The movie itself was a huge success, as it quickly rose to become the sixth-most popular film on Netflix after its release. It later ranked as the most-watched on Netflix in Nigeria in 2020.</p><p><strong>List of Awards and Nominations</strong></p><ul><li>Revelation of the Year at 2020 Best of Nollywood Awards (Nominated)</li><li>Best Actress at the 2021 Ghana Movie Awards (Won)</li><li>Most Searched Person at the 2021 Net Awards (Nominated)</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=temi-otedola-is-reportedly-worth-2-million></span><strong>Temi Otedola Is Reportedly Worth $2 Million</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Being the daughter of a billionaire, many people have credited Temi’s success to her father’s wealth. This was almost the same thing that was said about her sister DJ Cuppy when she first came onto the scene. Due to this, Temi’s work has been largely looked down on, but the actress does not pay any mind to such comments. The most recent time such a comment was made was after she began to receive rave reviews for her performance in Citation.</p><p>Following the movie’s release, it did not take long before the actress received a nomination for the Revelation of the Year Award at the 2020 Best of Nollywood Awards. Many kicked against her nomination, saying that the movie had not spent enough time in circulation for her to be considered for the award. As you would expect, her father’s influence and popularity were pointed to as why this was able to happen.</p><p>Regardless of people’s opinion, Citation performed very well, and its lead actress was certainly well-remunerated for her role. Details of what she received are, however, not public knowledge. In 2021, Temi Otedola added the title of podcaster to her list of descriptions after she began hosting a podcast titled How Far with her boyfriend, Mr. Eazi.</p><p>On the podcast, the duo dishes out juicy details about their relationship and discusses any other thing that piques their interest. The podcast has become very popular, garnering thousands of listeners across Nigeria and beyond. Add that to what she earns from all of her endeavors, including fashion blogging and modeling, and you can see why she is said to be worth a deserving $2 million.</p><p><strong>Summary of Temi Otedola’s Income Sources</strong></p><ul><li>Blogging</li><li>Modeling</li><li>Acting</li><li>Podcast</li><li>Her other business endeavors</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKyVorZuu9Oem6ikkWKuqLGMm6Con6KWvanFjJqlnWWemsFuw86rq6Fln5t6p7HMomSorJWZvK2t0majmqukYrGiwcahq56qXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sicily-rose.html><span>←</span><span>Sicily Rose</span></a>
