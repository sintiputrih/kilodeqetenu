Her dedication to her family and adherence to her independence captivated viewers from the start.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Today, she's taking on another challenge, the world of professional wrestling, She exclusively told TheThings about this journey and her life updates since appearing on the show.</p><h2 id=introducing-39-90-day-fiance-39>Introducing '90 Day Fiance'</h2><p><strong>I would love to hear about your time on '90 Day Fiancé' and your wrestling career!</strong></p><p>"You guys know we have been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">with TLC</a> for seven years since I came to the United States. We started '90 Day Fiancé,' we call ourselves the originals because we actually started (the show). We did 'Happily Ever After' and it's been some shows on the side like 'Pillow Talk.'"</p><p>"The biggest one, when we actually shared more about our lives, we're taking a break. It's actually really good to take a break from so much drama, so much things that happen when you do the shows. But, I'm always grateful and it's always a great opportunity to be part of this amazing franchise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>How is the RV life? Is that now specifically for your wrestling career?</strong></p><p>"Yes! We were thinking, wanting to actually start traveling and go to new places here in the U.S. because it's huge! Axel is still a baby, I say a baby <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">but he's a toddler</a>, and it's a great time to actually do it. Everything in wrestling is in Florida, so I haven't been able to travel a lot."</p><p>"The idea was to take this opportunity to have the RV and maybe be in Orlando for one month, Miami for one month because I really love Florida. So it's hard to make decisions."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'90 Day Fiance': Kelly Reacts To Molly Admitting That She Can't Have Kids</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans of Mayfield can take a look at her YouTube channel to see how much work goes into preparing a lifestyle on a road. While she always has a positive smile on her face in family vlogs, it's a lengthy and detailed process to make an RV feel like home.</p><h2 id=her-career-amp-marriage>Her Career & Marriage</h2><p><strong>We saw on the show that you started your modeling career and that created some rifts in your relationship. How have you both worked on traveling and helping your career grow?</strong></p><p>"For the modeling, I feel like I was doing more than modeling. I feel like people sometimes misunderstand the meaning of modeling, they think it's just about runway. It's more than that and for me, focusing was more about pictures. I know my height, I'm not that tall to be a runway model."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Also, it was kind of hard having those problems with Russ, for him not accepting me to go through that. I don't want to be doing something (with which) someone is not happy. That took a lot of stress. But I feel like you have to take care of yourself. I've always been into fitness. In 2014 I started this fitness journey."</p><p>She expressed that the mixture of modeling, personal training, and wrestling all connect. She needs to stay fit to fully perform in the squared circle.</p><p>She's transitioning into the industry aspect of it all and is already making strides in this exciting venture. The reality star said wrestling is the hardest thing she's done since giving birth to her son without any medication.</p><p><strong>How did you come up with the name Paola Blaze?</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"So I started with just 'Paolo' and I was like I don't know, I don't want to use my married name. The owner of Magic City, Lucas. He was like, 'Hey, I'm thinking about something cool for you.' I was like yes, I wanted something that catches. I wanted something fiery, people know that I'm bringing the fire."</p><p>Paola Blaze clicked, and her fire-engine hair matches the intense persona that she brings to every match. She and her manager <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dominique Enchinton</a>, owner of talent agency Dominton Talent House, have been working tirelessly on her next moves to accompany her aspirations.</p><h2 id=advice-to-young-athletes>Advice To Young Athletes</h2><p><strong>What have you learned about navigating your career that you would give to young wrestlers?</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I have to be super honest, it hasn't been easy. I've been in a lot of gossip, a lot of situations with people in the industry that have actually made me feel like I want to quit. I put my energy into me wanting to take this further. (There's been) so many obstacles.</p><p>"I really like wrestling, I really have so much passion for it. I feel like you've got to be stronger than the obstacles that are around you because that's life. Life is never going to be easy."</p><h2 id=family-amp-friends-since-the-show>Family & Friends Since The Show</h2><p><strong>On the show, you had some challenges with Russ's mom. How is your relationship with her today?</strong></p><p>"We went to Oklahoma last Christmas and we're getting along very well...There's some things that happened, but it's in the past. Patty and I have a great relationship. She just texted me recently to tell me that she sent a (care) box. We don't talk all the time, but I always ask for her, how she's doing. She does the same. We've been good for a while!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Things On Season 8 Of '90 Day Fiance' That Don't Add Up</a></span></p><p><strong>With your friends from Colombia, have you rekindled that bond?</strong></p><p>"Well, Juan and I are not friends anymore. We actually broke up our friendship last year, I think in the beginning of 2020. We stopped talking to each other, we don't have communication. My husband, he doesn't say he likes the idea but is more comfortable with the idea of me not being friends with him."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I feel like people who are meant to be part of your life will be part of your life, even if you are far away. Unfortunately, it didn't work with Juan and I think that's for the best...Right now I have. a friend who, I've known him for such a short time. He's done more than what Juan has done in the years of friendship I had with him. It's not about years, it's about quality friendship."</p><p>We can all take a note from Mayfield's book. Her wisdom on the power of self-worth is impeccable. Whether that means setting boundaries with long-term friends or going after new dreams that may feel scary, she has the courage to place herself and her family above everything.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Exclusive: Molly Hopkins Of '90 Day: The Single Life' Opens Up About Relationship With Kelly Brown</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicsZucqsCqwsRmp5qnnJZ6rq3Yn6CepJRivKd5mGlknZmpYrOqrc2cnGannmKzs7XEp5usoJmleqO%2BxJqirqijYq6vsIywqZ6rpKG2r7OO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./did-mindy-kaling-have-plastic-surgery.html><span>←</span><span>Did Mindy Kaling have plastic surgery?</span></a>
