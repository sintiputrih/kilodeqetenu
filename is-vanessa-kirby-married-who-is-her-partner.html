If not, who’s her partner? Keep reading to find the answer.</span></p><h3><b>Is Vanessa Kirby Married?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>No, Vanessa Kirby isn’t married. However, she plans to get married soon and start a family of her own one day. But for the time being, she’s happy advising her friends on pregnancy and parenthood.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“I am so obsessed with everyone’s birthing stories after doing Pieces of a Woman,” Vanessa shared. “With my best friend, Anna, when she told me she was pregnant, I would be like, ‘So basically you are on month four, so now…’ Who am I to start giving people advice about it? I have never bloody done it!”</span></p><h3><b>Who Is Vanessa Kirby Partner?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Vanessa Kirby is in a relationship with her partner Paul Rabil. The two were last seen as they departed Chiltern Firehouse in London in March 2023. For the occasion, Vanessa bundled up in a long wool coat with a pair of black leather trousers layered underneath while Paul wore a light grey jumper with a pair of smart trousers and some white trainers.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Sadly, we don’t know when the duo exactly started dating as they never featured each other on their social media. However, they’ve been a pair since September 2022. At the time, the lovebirds were first seen leaving the Crosby Hotel together and the next month, they were spotted strolling around in NYC.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Prior to Vanessa, her partner was in a relationship with the Mexican actress Eiza Gonzalez and was married to fellow sportswoman Kelly Berger, from 2014 until 2017.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>For those who don’t know, Paul Rabil is the co-founder of the </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Premiere Lacrosse League</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. Also, he’s a partner of Rabil Ventures and co-founder of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Rabil Companies</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. But before all this, Paul used to be a Lacrosse player himself who played for the US for over 12 years. So far, he’s played college lacrosse at </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Johns Hopkins University </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>where he was named a 4x All-American. Furthermore, Rabil is a 2x World Champion, a 3x Professional Lacrosse Champion, a 3x Professional Lacrosse MVP, and a 2x NCAA Division I Champion.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>In 2019, Rabil was also selected for the PLL All-Star Game.</span></p><h3><b>Vanessa Kirby Dating History</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Prior to Paul, Vanessa Kirby was linked to Christopher Abbott for a while. The pair first met when they played a married couple in 19th Century romantic drama </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The World To Come</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in 2020.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>And before Paul, the </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Mission: Impossible</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> star dated Callum Turner from 2015 to 2019. The two first met as co-stars in 2014’s </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Queen and Country</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. Over the next four 4 years, the two then “gradually [grew] apart” in a “very amicable” way.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>A source said, “The split happened a few weeks ago and it wasn’t ugly at all. Their work schedules just weren’t aligning and it put a strain on their relationship. They’re going to remain friends though!”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>During the time Vanessa was with Callum, she was also rumored to have linked with Tom Cruise after a photo of the two kissing — while in character and on set — somehow made the rounds as proof of a relationship. “The most disconcerting thing was the people I didn’t think would believe it, did, and they were texting my boyfriend, asking, ‘Are you OK?’ I don’t think they believe anything they read now because you just can’t. None of it is real. To be getting married to him? Not even a snog, it was marriage,”&nbsp; Vanessa later slammed the rumor.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>How Old Is Vanessa Kirby?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Vanessa was born on April 18, 1988.

So, they had this incredible thing where they were like, you can do anything,” Vanessa shared.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But though Vanessa has such strong parents, she had so much self-doubt growing up. “Oh my goodness, I still do. I have made peace with the fact that it is there,” she explained. “It’s the practice of letting it be in the passenger seat. You have to say: ‘You are not going to drive but you can be here’.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Fortunately, Vanessa has Christopher McQuarrie who lent her loads of books on power and how to transmit power — “the more you reel it in, the more intimidating it is,” the actor shared.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Besides her parents, Vanessa was close to her siblings Juliet and Joe Kirby.</span></p><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>What Is Vanessa Kirby Height?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Vanessa stands tall at a height of 5 feet 7 inches (170 cm).</span></p><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>How Much Is Vanessa Kirby Net Worth?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>By 2023, Vanessa garnered a net worth of above $4 million.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>An actor by profession, Vanessa started her career in 2019 as “Jane” in </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Love/Loss</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.
