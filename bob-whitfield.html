From 1992 to 2003, he played for the Falcons. He then spent the 2004 season with the Jacksonville Jaguars. Whitfield started at left tackle for the New York Giants in 2006, filling in after starter Luke Petitgout was injured. His time as a starter was defined by two instances of him losing his cool and drawing costly personal fouls, once on headbutts in key moments against the Dallas Cowboys and again in a Week 16 loss to the New Orleans Saints.</p><p>Many Giants fans and local columnists dubbed him “Head-butt Bob” as a result of his actions. Whitfield was benched for the final game of the season against the Washington Redskins and the subsequent playoff game against the Philadelphia Eagles as a result of these actions and general inconsistency. On Sirius NFL radio on February 12, 2007, he announced his retirement. Whitfield is the founder and CEO of Patchwerks, Inc., which opened PatchWerk Recording Studios in Atlanta, GA in 1993.</p><p>The studio, which provides recording, production, mixing, and mastering services, has recorded and/or mixed over 500 gold and platinum albums, including portions of OutKast’s ATLiens and Goodie Mob’s Still Standing. T.I., Nelly, 50 Cent, Snoop Dogg, Missy Elliott, Beyoncé, 112, Busta Rhymes, TLC, Whitney Houston, Ras Kass, Toni Braxton, Sting, Cher, Madonna, Annie Lennox, and many others have also worked with the studio. In 2009, the studio was separated from its parent company in order to focus on investments in film and television.</p><p>Whitfield also contributes to local Atlanta television and radio as a guest analyst for Sky Sports’ NFL coverage in the United Kingdom. Whitfield was inducted into Stanford University’s Hall of Fame on November 11, 2011, and in an interview. Whitfield admitted that he was thinking about returning to his alma mater to finish his degree. Whitfield returned to Stanford in 2012 and graduated with honors in economics during a Father’s Day ceremony attended by his children.</p><h2>Bob Whitfield Net Worth</h2><p>The net worth of the retired American football player is $14 million as of November 2023. Bob Whitfield amassed his fortune while playing tackle for the Atlanta Falcons, Jacksonville Jaguars, and New York Giants in the National Football League.</p><h2>Bob Whitfield Wife, Marriage</h2><p>Bob Whitfield was Married to Sheree Whitfield. Bob was a football player for the Atlanta Falcons from 1992 to 2003, but we meet a few years after he retired. Sheree claimed that Bob was abusive during their marriage. They have two children, Kaleigh and Kairo, born in 1996 and 1999, respectively. Bob pays Sheree child support for both children, but the courts have not ordered him to pay alimony. She appealed the decision to deny alimony due to her lack of formal education and lack of a skilled trade or profession, but she lost the case as well as the home they shared.</p><p>Sheree Whitfield was dating Tyrone Gilliams when she appeared on The Real Housewives of Atlanta. Tyrone was in federal prison serving a 10-year sentence, so their relationship was long-distance. On Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen: @ Home on Sunday (May 10), she provided an update on their friendship. Andy also wanted to know how things were going with her ex-husband, Bob Whitfield, who is the father of two of her children. The couple divorced in 2007 and later opened up about their difficult past on RHOA Season 9.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiZqJpdrLWqwMWinKWcXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./corey-pritchett-jr-s-girlfriend-list.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Corey Pritchett Jr. Dating Corey Pritchett Jr.'s Girlfriend &amp;amp; Exes</span></a>
