She always orders prawn firecrackers with extra sauce from her favourite restaurant ‘Wagamama,’ which is a British food chain, serving Asian food.</li></ul><ul><li>In an interview, on being asked about what kind of job roles are offered to an outsider or a person of a different race as compared to years back, she shared,</li></ul><p>There are more parts that say ‘non-race specific’. Years ago, there was one Asian person in a soap and the entire Asian acting community was going for that role. Now, you can find a few different Asian people, and their character isn’t entirely based on their religion or culture: they just happen to be in a soap. But we’ve got a long way to go and I hope that, in time, I can audition for anything and just worry about being the best person for the job, not the right race.</p><ul><li>On being asked in an interview about what would make her turn a role down, to which she replied,</li></ul><p>When it comes to playing a character that’s not a Sikh, as I am, I always think, “Would I do this if the character was Sikh? Would I offend anyone in my family?” If the answer is no [to the latter], then I would always play the part. But there are still so many other roles that I would love to play, and hopefully I’m in a position after&nbsp;Doctor Who to be a bit choosier about which ones I do. I want to play Wonder Woman.</p><h3>Related posts:</h3><a class=yarpp-thumbnail rel=norewrite href=# title="Jessica Madsen Wiki, Age, Height, Boyfriend, Family, Biography & More"><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-default><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bignamebio.com/wp-content/plugins/yet-another-related-posts-plugin/images/default.png alt="Default Thumbnail" data-pin-nopin=true style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-title>Jessica Madsen Wiki, Age, Height, Boyfriend, Family, Biography & More</span></a> <a class=yarpp-thumbnail rel=norewrite href=# title="Amita Suman Wiki, Height, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography & More"><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-default><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bignamebio.com/wp-content/plugins/yet-another-related-posts-plugin/images/default.png alt="Default Thumbnail" data-pin-nopin=true style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-title>Amita Suman Wiki, Height, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography & More</span></a> <a class=yarpp-thumbnail rel=norewrite href=# title="Billy Howle Wiki, Height, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography & More"><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-default><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bignamebio.com/wp-content/plugins/yet-another-related-posts-plugin/images/default.png alt="Default Thumbnail" data-pin-nopin=true style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-title>Billy Howle Wiki, Height, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography & More</span></a> <a class=yarpp-thumbnail rel=norewrite href=# title="Gabrielle Brooks Wiki, Height, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography & More"><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-default><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bignamebio.com/wp-content/plugins/yet-another-related-posts-plugin/images/default.png alt="Default Thumbnail" data-pin-nopin=true style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-title>Gabrielle Brooks Wiki, Height, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography & More</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamZy7ornEm6CoZpOkunC5wKeboqhdnLatuI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./joyland-had-to-fight-to-be-seen-html.html><span>←</span><span>Joyland Had to Fight to Be Seen</span></a>
