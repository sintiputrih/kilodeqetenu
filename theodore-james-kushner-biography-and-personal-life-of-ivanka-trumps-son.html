Reports have it that he was precisely born on the aforementioned date at 5:43 p.m. Given his date of birth, he is <span>7 years old at the moment, and his place of birth is New York City, New York, United States.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Theodore’s mother, Ivanka Trump, was 34 years old when he was born. Per records, Ivanka was born on the 30th of October 1981 and is currently 42 years old. On the other hand, his father, Jared Kushner, was 35 years old when Theodore was born. Jared was also born in 1981 but on the 10th of January. He is 42 years old at the moment.&nbsp;</span></p><p>As it was with his older siblings, Theodore’s arrival was announced to the world on <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>. His mother took to the platform to disclose his name while she expressed that she and her husband Jared felt incredibly blessed for the arrival of Theodore. A delighted Ivanka also shared with the public that choosing the baby’s name was a tad difficult. According to her, she had to go through the old list of names she had penned down to pick the right name for her second son.</p><p>Theodore’s birth sign is Aries. Those who believe that people’s zodiac defines their behavior would expect Theodore to be very kind, sympathetic, bold, and full of intense energy. Those qualities aren’t far from who Theodore is. When he marked his seventh birth anniversary, his mother took to Instagram to celebrate him. She described him as a kind child with a positive and energetic spirit.</p><h2><strong>He Has Jewish Heritage Thanks to his Dad</strong></h2><p>Theodore James Kushner’s maternal grandfather Donald Trump was the 45th president of the United States, and just like his granddad, he is an American citizen. Theodore was two months shy of his second birthday when his grandfather was inaugurated as president; this was on the 20th of January 2017. In terms of his ethnicity, Theodore is of mixed European descent and also of Jewish ancestry.</p><p>His family has Czech, German, Scottish, and Jewish roots. His maternal grandmother Ivana Marie Trump was a Czech-American woman, and his maternal grandfather Donald Trump is of German and Scottish ancestry. Theodore’s father, Jared Kushner, is Jewish. He was raised in a Morden Orthodox Jewish family. According to reports, his paternal grandparents were Holocaust survivors who came to the United States in 1949 from Navahrudak, a town you would find in the Grodon region of Belarus.</p><p>Because of the differences in family background, Theodore James Kushner’s parents almost didn’t end up together. His mother, Ivanka, was raised a Presbyterian Christian. After she met Theodore’s father, they broke up for a while over their religious differences. But eventually, Ivanka Trump converted to Orthodox Judaism, and they reunited. Alongside his two older siblings, Theodore is being brought up as a Jew.</p><h2><strong>Key Facts About Theodore James Kushner’s Family</strong></h2><table><tr><th><strong>Family Member</strong></th><th><strong>Relationship</strong></th><th><strong>Details</strong></th></tr><tbody readability=9><tr readability=2><td><strong>Jared Kushner</strong></td><td>Father</td><td>American businessman and former senior advisor to President Donald Trump.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td><strong>Ivanka Trump</strong></td><td>Mother</td><td>American businesswoman and former senior advisor to President Donald Trump.

We gathered that, alongside his siblings, he attends the Milton Gottesman Jewish Day School in Washington, DC. At the moment, it is hard to tell what he would like to do for a living. Theodore is still a child with his future ahead of him. All that matters right now is his education and the quality time he spends with friends and relatives.</p><p>Having said that, he is an active child who enjoys playing soccer. In February 2023, his mother, Ivanka Trump, shared on Instagram that she received a call from Theodore’s school which informed her that he broke his wrist while playing soccer. He was rushed to Joe DiMaggio Children’s Hospital for treatment, and his parents joined him there.</p><h2><strong>Theodore James Kushner’s Parents Have Been Together Since 2005</strong></h2><p>Theodore James Kushner’s parents reportedly met in 2005. As the story goes, they met through a mutual friend who is a real estate broker. This friend imagined that Jared and Ivanka would get along doing business together, but as fate would have it, they were instantly attracted to each other. They began dating and soon realized that they were up for spending the rest of their lives together.</p><p>Weighing their compatibility, Theodore’s parents realized that their religious difference would pose a problem for them. As reported in some quarters, Jared Kushner’s parents disapproved of Ivanka as they wanted a Jewish woman for their son. Theodore’s parents fell apart because of this and parted ways in 2008; however, it only lasted for a while.</p><p>Realizing what they mean to each other, they reunited that same year as Ivanka decided to convert to Judaism. The next year, Jared asked for Ivanka’s hand in marriage with a 5.22-carat diamond engagement ring. A few months later, they exchanged marital vows. Theodore’s parents got married on the 25th of October 2009. Theirs was a Jewish ceremony that took place at the Trump National Golf Club in New Jersey.</p><h2><strong>Theodore James Kushner Has Two Older Siblings</strong></h2><p>Theodore’s parents, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner have three children altogether, and he is the youngest of them all. This means he has two older siblings: an older sister named Arabella Rose Kushner and an older brother named Joseph Frederick Kushner.</p><p>His parents were approaching their second year in marriage when they had Arabella, the oldest of his two siblings. She was born on the 17th of July 2011 and is 12 years old at the moment. Over two years later, Theodore’s older brother joined the family.</p><p>Joseph was born on the 14th of October 2013 and is 10 years old right now. So Theodore is five years younger than his older sister Arabella and two years younger than his brother Joseph.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571KxmraCVpLGwvsRmoZqllah6rMHSoaWeql2XtrCz0ZqnobFdlrulec%2Beqaynnpa5brjIn5xmp5ZitretzaSYZqyiqrqxv4yspqdn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lisa-p-jackson-net-worth-236029.html><span>←</span><span>Lisa P.
