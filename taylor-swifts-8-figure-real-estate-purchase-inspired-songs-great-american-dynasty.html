Harkness' philosophy was to use her wealth and not keep it. She spent the majority of her fortune on dance before she passed away in 1982 from cancer.</p><p>According to Teen Vogue, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harkness once told a reporter in 1965</a>:</p><p>"All the sensible things I've tried to do have turned out to be a mess, so I decided, 'Why not do what I want?' I'll be so disgusted with myself when I'm 70 if I haven't done anything with my energy, talent, and money. I like to see money used.

Harkness is infamous for not conforming to societal norms, which piqued Swift's interest with her unabashed ownership of desires and wildness.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Swift expressed admiration for a woman unapologetically embracing free and shared anecdotes about Harkness in each room of her Rhode Island mansion during tours. Thanks to Swift, Harkness' life has become immortalized for generations of music fans. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swift told Entertainment Weekly in 2020:</a></p><p>"Anyone who's been there before knows that I do 'The Tour,' where I show everyone through the house. And I tell them different anecdotes about each room, because I've done that much research on this house and this woman. So, in every single room, there's a different anecdote about Rebekah Harkness..."</p><p>Harkness was criticized in Watch Hill for her lavish lifestyle and the perceived downfall of the Harkness family name. In the chorus of the song, Swift reflects on Harkness' recklessness, singing, "There goes the last great American dynasty. She had a marvelous time ruining everything." She later shifts the perspective to the first person in the final chorus, drawing a parallel between Harkness' story and her own, "There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen. I had a marvelous time ruining everything."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>4:54</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Truth About Taylor Swift Employing Her Younger Brother, Austin Swift</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift's younger brother, Austin Swift has been listed alongside the singer on several of her projects.</span><p>Swift's time at Holiday House made headlines for various reasons, including <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her security team's presence on the public beach</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">celebrity Fourth of July parties</a>, and paparazzi-filled outings with her then-boyfriend, Tom Hiddleston. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Locals expressed concerns about the attention Swift brought</a> to the community, leading the governor of Rhode Island, Gina Raimondo, to propose a tax on second homes over $1 million, dubbed the "Taylor Swift" tax, which was later withdrawn.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina2rXW16p7XGrqmeZaKarq15xKyrmqyVYr22vsKhmKydXZ67tLzIq5ydZaOku6i%2FjKCpnpmkYq6usdGimpqmXZnGr63SrbBo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./snapchat-down-error-code-c14a-explained.html><span>←</span><span>Snapchat down: error code C14A, explained</span></a>
