Turns out that Aniston made like Rachel, who worked as a coffeehouse waitress for the sitcom's first few seasons, and also waited tables in New York City.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I was such a grown-up by then," Aniston said during the interview, referring to the early years of her rising fame following Friends' success. "I had moved away from home. I had been on six failed television shows. I waitressed for years in New York before I got anything. And I was a telemarketer selling time-shares in the Poconos. I didn't make one sale. I was terrible at it. I was like, 'Why do we have to call people at dinnertime?'"</p><img alt="NBC Allstars Party 1990" title="NBC Allstars Party 1990" width=2087 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jennifer-aniston-at-the-in-los-angeles-ca-news-photo-75517569-1567628886.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Barry King</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Aniston circa 1990.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Besides waitressing and failing to make sells on Poconos time-shares, Aniston revealed that she once held a gig cutting hair. "I cut hair for 10 bucks a head in junior high. I could probably cut your hair," she said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She also divulged that she would cut the hair of her father, actor John Aniston. “I cut my dad's hair, and he was on a soap opera [Days of Our Lives]. But then he admitted to me 15 years ago that he would go in and have the hairdresser on set clean it up.”</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/1025b301-1f7f-4f4b-80fe-228ddf464aff_1642017719.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" title="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>As an associate editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, Chelsey keeps a finger on the pulse on all things celeb news.
