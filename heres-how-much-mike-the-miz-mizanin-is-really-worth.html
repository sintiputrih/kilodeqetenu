For starters, in 2017,&nbsp;<a href=#>Realtor</a>&nbsp;reported the&nbsp;Mizanins sold their Hollywood Hills abode for $3.05 million. Sure, it went under listing, but they still made a profit: The Miz purchased it for just (yes, just!) $1.865 million, according to the&nbsp;<a href=#>Los Angeles Times</a>.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>At the time, the Mizanins wanted to leave LA for somewhere more private. "People knew where we lived," The Miz told&nbsp;<a href=#>The Wrap</a>. "They'd be driving past us taking pictures of our house everyday." While they originally wanted to move to Vegas because it's a tax free state and close enough to LA, they briefly ended up in Austin, Texas. The couple purchased a home there for $2.35 million, according to&nbsp;<a href=#>Dirt</a>, but ended up selling it in 2019. As Realtor noted, they raked in $2.64 million for the property, once again making a profit.</p><p dir=ltr>Yet, The Miz really broke the bank in 2019 when he and his wife purchased a massive, 1.27-acre estate in Thousand Oaks, California, for a whopping $6.4 million. Mizanin appears to be quite proud of his home, which he calls Manor MarMiz. He even gave fans a <a href=#>tour</a> of the spread, which of course boasts luxurious features like a full bar, as well as a music room, and game room. It's clear The Miz is living the good life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb2xga4Jze8eeqZ6rXZ28uHnMrpqhZZ2euKZ506GcZqWZr3qutdmapaKmXZ7Abr7EmqOlsV2svLPAx2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./asus-launches-maximus-viii-extremeassembly-for-skylake-includes-10g-ethernet-card.html><span>←</span><span>ASUS Launches Maximus VIII Extreme/Assembly for Skylake, includes 10G Ethernet Card</span></a>
