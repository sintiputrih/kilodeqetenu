They have all sorts of money and can really buy anything, yet they choose to pay hundreds of dollars for dirty, worn out shoes? Yep. It's no different from buying vintage distressed denim; those are definitely worn out and a lot of times look used, and that's the appeal. <a href=#>Selena Gomez</a>, Megan Fox, Taylor Swift, and Reese Witherspoon are just a few of the stars wearing them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#>The Founders Of Veja Campos Sneakers Kind Of Wish The Royals Hadn't Been Seen In Their Shoes</a></span></p><p>Similar to the jeans we purchase, these shoes are not worn out, old, or even dirty. They are hand painted to look that way. What brand are we talking about? Golden Goose sneakers, of course. They are easy to spot because they have fake scuffs and dirt marks all over the upper, and they are usually on the feet of a celebrity. That's because they cost anywhere from $500 to $2,000 a pair.</p><h2 id=why-are-golden-goose-sneakers-so-expensive>Why Are Golden Goose Sneakers So Expensive?</h2><p>Golden Goose sneakers are more expensive than the vast majority of Nikes, Guccis, and Pradas. Not quite <a href=#>as expensive as Louis Vuitton</a> or <a href=#>Kylie Jenner's Balenciaga's</a> but those are really extreme.</p><p>Golden Goose sneakers are handmade in Italy. Like most products that come from Italy, a lot of attention to detail goes into the product. Golden Goose sneakers are no different. Every pair of shoes that a customer buys has been through a long, hard process by a professional. Both the painting and the distressing of the shoes are also done by hand.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3-9.jpg><p>You can bet that these people are not making a simple minimum wage. It is a known fact that Italian shoemakers, and those who work for them, make a good living at this job. That wage needs to be paid somehow, so like all products, it's tacked onto the price.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#>From Hailey Beiber's Ugg Slides To Jennifer Lopez's Gucci Slides All Ranked For Summer</a></span></p><p>Being handmade, the shoes are incredibly comfortable, and the leather is so soft. Pictures don't really do them justice; seeing them in person, you can really see a difference between them and your everyday casual sneaker. <a href=#>For example, Cardi B Reebok's</a> vs Golden Goose, you would notice a big difference in the stitching and the leather.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The uniqueness of Golden Goose sneakers is possibly one of the main factors contributing to their high price. Each pair of shoes is unique. Even a pair of shoes is not exactly the same. Each one is as distinctive as a person's fingerprint thanks to the subtle variations in their distressing.</p><p>One pair of shoes may have more color in the distressing than the other, for instance. Another might have a pattern that is slightly different. The skid mark on one shoe may be shorter or completely absent on the other shoe. Golden Goose purposefully does this to show how unique they are.</p><h2 id=what-are-golden-goose-sneakers-made-of>What Are Golden Goose Sneakers Made Of?</h2><p>Golden Goose's shoes are expensive in part because of the materials that are used to make them. Italian clothing is known for using<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> the highest-quality leather.</a> Golden Goose shoes do too. Calfskin leather is the main type of leather used to manufacture their shoes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jenna Ortega Makes Us Want To Work Out, Or At Least Look Like We Do, In Her Latest Sportswear</a></span></p><p>Due to the fact that it is made from calf hides, this leather is expensive. Italy holds its leather to incredibly high standards.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2-10.jpg><p>To maintain their calves' best health, farmers incur significant costs. The calf's skin and, consequently, its leather are better the healthier the animal is. Since calfskin leather costs a lot to produce, it has a high cost of sale.</p><h2 id=what-are-the-best-dupes-for-golden-goose-sneakers>What Are The Best Dupes For Golden Goose Sneakers?</h2><p>There are plenty of dupes for Golden Goose sneakers, but for the most part, they're based on looks alone. The public has more often than not, never seen Golden Goose sneaks up close and personal, so it's likely they won't be able to tell the difference.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you are looking to tell the difference, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Goose has a trademark on where the star is placed on their shoe</a>. No other shoe can place the star in that spot on look-a-likes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/4-9.jpg><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Steve Madden Women's Rezume Sneaker</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Golden Goose Superstars </a></strong>(Glitter Star)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/5-7.jpg><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">PARTY Women's Fashion Star Sneaker</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Golden Goose Superstars</a></strong> (snakeskin star)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/6-6.jpg><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Vintage Havana Alexis 1</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/7-6.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><strong>Golden Goose Glitter Upper</strong></a></p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Vintage Havana Uppers</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwMieqmallZyur3nFqK9mmZ6ZerSxy56lmmWXpLqmxoygpqWclaN6qLvOrJxmq56arqyx0axksKCpYq6zsYytn56xXai8brHXqZynq5mrsnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./southern-charms-shep-rose-shows-off-bachelor-pad-pictures.html><span>←</span><span>Southern Charms Shep Rose Shows Off Bachelor Pad: Pictures</span></a>
