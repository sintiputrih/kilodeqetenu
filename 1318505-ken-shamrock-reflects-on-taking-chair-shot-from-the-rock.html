When asked about taking a dangerous chair shot from The Rock on an episode of Monday Night RAW in 1998, Shamrock revealed it was his idea to take it right on his forehead.</p><p>“Nobody has ever taken a shot like that. Now you see people doing all the time,” Ken Shamrock said. “So it’s actually safer to take a shot with your forehead, not your face. It looks like your face, but it’s your forehead. Because that’s how you hit people when you’re playing football or like the strongest part of your head is your forehead to get in top your head or the back your head, that’s dangerous and I just wasn’t going to take it like that. So I literally said I wanted the shot to my face. And the reason why I told him that was because I would be in control of where it landed.</p><p>“If he swang for my face, I would be in control of where it would land and that’s why I told him I want you to hit me in the face. And then he looked at me and said, you’re crazy. I said no, do it. I’ll take care of myself. You just make sure you swing it, hit me in the face. Otherwise, I ain’t selling it. And he said, oh, I’ll hit you. So it wasn’t bad. If it would have been the back of my head, I’d have been in the hospital. But because it was in the front, and I told him you better swing it because I knew I could take it.</p><p>“I’ve been in fights before and I’ve been playing football my whole life. And I knew if I got hit in the forehead, there’s nothing going to hurt me. And so it was comfortable for me to tell him that because I knew I would be okay. The only thing that could happen was the chair could collapse. I could get cut. But that was okay. I was willing to take that risk. So when he swang it, I took it. I took it right in the forehead. He caught my nose too, but it was okay because I felt like I saw it coming and hit me in the forehead. And I went down and I keep telling people. Yeah, it was a hard shot but I wouldn’t have it any other way. But I fought my whole life, man, and so those are things I’m okay with. As long as I see it coming, I’m okay with it.”</p><p>&nbsp;<a href=#>Triple H On The Rock Returning To WWE: The Platform Is Certainly There, The Clock Is Ticking</a></p><p>What do you make of Ken Shamrock’s comments?
