Her mother’s name is <strong>Vibeke Boe,</strong> but the name of her father is not known to the general media. It’s kind of doubtful that her parents might not be together. Other than this, there is no information about any of the siblings.</p><p>Alisha belongs to Norwegian nationality, along with the mixed ethnicity. Her zodiac sign falls under Pisces.</p><h2>Age and Body Measurements</h2><p>Alisha was born in 1997, which makes her 22 years old as of now. She stands at the height of 5’4” with weight being 51 kgs. The smile highly aids her dark complexion skin. Boe’s vital body statistics stand at 35-27-34.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miles Heizer Age, Height, Movies, TV Shows, Net Worth, Dating >></a></h4><p>Alisha has been in the field of modeling, so maintaining a slim body is the need of the time. The shoe size of 6, along with the brown eyes, is something special.&nbsp; Her shining pair of eyes is well supported by flawless brown hair.</p><h2>Early Life and Education</h2><p>Boe was born in Norway and spent most of her childhood there with her mother. It is surprising to see the name of the father not mentioned most of the time. This suggests the fact that her parents separated early. Most of the needs were fulfilled with ease. Added to that, there was a considerable amount of freedom to be an actress.</p><p>In the case of educational background, though, she attended Ivy Academia in LA. After this, however, she was part of George Ellery Hale Middle School. But surprisingly, this lady dropped out of school to try mettle in acting.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Readers who have reached this segment might have known she is a dropout and started acting. Well, she started acting at the age of 11. Alisha was part of a horror movie named Amusement. Looking at her class and composure, works began to flow for her.</p><p>Other good movie works include like of He’s On My Mind, Plastics Makes Perfect, 68 Kill, Poms, and many more. Amidst her outstanding work in movies, what remains her go-to genre is undoubtedly the TV works. In the year 2012, the debut came with Parenthood.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cailin Russo Age, Height, Model, Music, Dating, Net Worth >></a></h4><p>Likewise, work started to flow on and on. Trophy Wife, Modern Family, Extant, NCIS, Casual, Teen Wolf are some prominent examples. Other than the ones mentioned above, 13 Reasons Why inevitably broke the dam for her, and she received worldwide accolades.</p><h2>Boyfriend. Who Is Alisha Boe Boyfriend?</h2><p>Alisha is one of those actresses who is more focused on making a career first rather than being in a relationship. The audience likes her works. But the personal life is way under the radar.</p><p>Sources at this point claim she is single at times; however, rumors flow the circuit that she is dating <strong>Scott O Brien</strong>. With no response from the actress to this, we feel all of these are false ones.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/alisha-429.jpg><p>But one thing is sure she is not married or engaged. Whatever it might be, the diva is surely good friends with all of the 13 Reasons Why cast. To add the friendship pillar, she has a matching tattoo with Tommy Dorfman. Looking at the success Boe is earning, we feel she will quickly find the perfect one.</p><h2>Net Worth. How Much Is Alisha Boe Worth?</h2><p>Hollywood is a fruitful plant that produces rewards with undying dedication. Alisha also falls under the same radar, who is a decade old in the industry. But something unusual about Alisha is the fact that there is no information on net worth.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Katherine Langford: Gay, Early life, Education, Age, Bio, Height >></a></h4><p>Her secrecy is entirely understood as she might be a tad introverted or skeptical about sharing personal life information. Not only the net worth but the annual salary with assets owned is also a far cry. Nevertheless, we can say with ease that it is in the six-digit figure.</p><h2>Social Media Reach</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Instagram</a>– 4.1million followers</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Twitter</a>– 269k followers</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmispqi1sMPSrZirq16YvK57wKWgrKCRYq%2BwsYyanp5lmJq2qLTTZpqaqpWav26uzrKdq6GVo7FuusStZLCnoqm1cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./robert-blake-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Robert Blake Net Worth How Much is Robert Worth?</span></a>
