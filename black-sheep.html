 Dec 19th 2020 !⃝ “Hello again, friend of a friend, I knew you when
Our common goal was waiting for the world to end
Now that the truth is just a rule that you can bend
You crack the whip, shape-shift and trick the past again”
IMO the song seems it’s about two exes who had a really strong connection but had to breakup."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

They now refer to each other as “friend of a friend” because they run with the same crowds still, and of course when they dated the common goal was to live and eventually die together (end of the world).<br>The truth that is referred to is the reasonings for their breakup and one ex is obviously manipulating the other (the singer) into thinking it’ll be ok to see each other and it taps straight into their feelings.</p><p>“Send you my love on a wire<br>Lift you up, every time, everyone, ooh, pulls away, ooh From you”</p><p>The manipulative ex was reaching out again because they had another failed relationship since their original breakup. But because the singer has such a soft spot for their ex they can’t help but be there to lift them up with their old love they once had. This clearly happens time and time again.</p><p>“Got balls of steel, got an automobile, for a minimum wage<br>Got real estate, I'm buying it all up in outer space<br>Now that the truth is just a rule that you can bend<br>You crack the whip, shape-shift and trick, the past again”</p><p>This ex has a lot of “balls” to keep reaching out after so many failed attempts, but the singer can’t help themselves. There is so much real estate in their heads that each other own and they can’t getaway from falling into this same pattern again.</p><p>“It's a mechanical bull, at number one<br>You'll take a ride from anyone<br>Everyone wants a ride, pulls away, ooh, from you”</p><p>This is a diss at the manipulative ex that they’re easy to get in their pants and everyone who does hits it and quits it. Each time the ex always comes running back hurting because they can’t find anyone as good as the singer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rcXRopqipqSav7G%2BxK2YraGfo8Bvr86mZqadpKe2pHvBpZico12otaaxzw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./malik-heard-net-worth-234200.html><span>←</span><span>Malik Heard Net Worth</span></a>
