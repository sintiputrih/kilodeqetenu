Triple H. Regarding her age, she is currently 11 years old and will turn 12 in August. Her sign is Virgo.</p><p>Levesque has a mixed ethnic heritage; her mother is of Irish descent, and her father is of French-Canadian descent. She is also American according to her nationality.</p><p>The star child, as we have mentioned, grew up in a wrestling family. Her maternal grandfather and great-great grandfather, in addition to her parents, both worked as boxing promoters. Her maternal uncle is also a professional wrestler.</p><h2><span id=Vaughn8217s_parents_wed_when_Do_they_remain_a_couple>Vaughn’s parents wed when? Do they remain a couple?</span></h2><p>Since their tenure in the WWE, her mother Stephanie McMahon and father Triple H have been dating. The real-life pair started out pretending to get along on screen and even got married in Las Vegas in late 1999.</p><p>Even though their on-screen romance was fictitious, the two were genuinely falling for one another. The influential pair chose to go even further in their relationship after dating for a few years. Therefore, they made their nuptials official on October 5, 2003. Since then, the couple has been together and they have three daughters together.</p><p>In fact, before proceeding down the aisle, the two split up twice. When Stephanie learned of her husband’s and Chyna’s secret relationship, they first broke up. She was originally enraged but eventually changed her attitude. She stated in a conversation on The Howard Stern Show:</p><p>They allegedly weren’t dating at the time. They shared a residence and are currently attempting to leave it or something similar. After seeing each other for a few months, we stopped talking for a while after I realized she was living in your home and that something was going on.</p><p>The second time was when Vince McMahon, Vaughn’s grandpa, made them part ways. Even though their relationship initially broke down twice, they went back together and are still together today without any breakup rumors.</p><p>The famous child is not the only one. Her two older sisters are a blessing. Aurora Rose Levesque, who was born on July 24th, 2006, is her elder sister. While Murphy Claire Levesque, the second-oldest sibling, was born on July 28, 2008.</p><p>All of their daughters, according to their famous parents, have a close bond and adore being around one another. But according to a statement made by their mother in an interview, due to the fame of their parents, bullies may find their girls easy prey. She believes that her girls are more susceptible to it because they were raised in a similar milieu.</p><p>Aurora Rose, Vaughn’s sister, is training to be a future champion because wrestling runs in the family.<br>Aurora Rose Levesque, her oldest sister, is the first to carry on her parent’s legacy. She is working hard to continue the family legacy and become a professional wrestler.</p><p>Their mother Stephanie stated that her oldest daughter is essentially committed to winning the women’s title and eventually succeeding as the Women’s Champion in an interview with ESPN.</p><p>She claimed during the interview that women now had many opportunities. In the same way, she stated of her girls, “They can become anything until and unless they put their mind to and work hard for it.”</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Eniko Hart And Her Parents, Especially Her Mother, Are Very Close</a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity Financee</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Mabel Ray Mulroney-Into The Life Of Dermot Mulroney’s Daughter</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>New Poster For ‘The Little Mermaid’ Is Unveiled By Dolby Cinema</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpaWys7%2FTmqmsm6Whwba%2BxGeaqKVfq662s8enZJ6ulaHGr3nLnq2eq6Gqsm7Ax55krqakpLmlecWamq2rXZavsMHTZquroaChsm600mabmq2XncGmvo4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./peter-angelos-son-john-p-angelos-age-wife-net-worth-what-does-john-p-angelos-do-for-a-living.html><span>←</span><span>Peter Angelos Son: John P.
