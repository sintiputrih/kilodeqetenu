Now the 15,000-square-foot building is home to The Foxtail On The Lake, a modern Mediterranean restaurant serving brick chicken, beef shawarma and paella.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">“We kept the original lights and we kept the original stained glass,” said David Villegas, a managing partner at The Foxtail On The Lake. “We also have a piece of the altar that we kept and that we’ve placed over the host stand.”</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Growing up near the church, Villegas admired the shiplike shape of the building and would often ride his bike on its surrounding trails. When he heard there was a possibility the structure could be razed, Villegas began to dream that the building could continue to serve the community as a dining establishment.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">“That’s when I decided to jump into action,” Villegas said. “I knew what was missing here.”</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Villegas joined forces with restaurateur Tim Canning and Chef Maya Nahouli to import the menu and concept of Downers Groves’ The Foxtail to the new location. With his partners and with the help of a grant and tax rebate from the city of Des Plaines, the year and a half long renovation of the religious center began, adding a 5,000-square-foot patio and 3,000-square-foot kitchen.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">“I didn’t know how much work it would entail, coming into this building, but it’s truly a work of art,” Villegas said. “Now it’s alive, and it’s rolling.”</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy"><b class=cXscX>RELATED: Orange County’s Mercado Gonzalez food hall and market is Mexican food wonderland</b></p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The Foxtail On The Lake seats 210 inside the restaurant and another 115 on the patio. Colorful art, brass trim and green plants accent what was once the sanctuary.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">“This has been a word-of-mouth situation that has just exploded on the scene,” Villegas said. “Everybody in the community has been well receptive, and the neighboring communities have been drawn into our space.”</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Villegas said that The Foxtail On The Lake means everything to him. Grateful for having grown up in the city of Des Plaines, he’s proud to be able to bring this concept to his old neighborhood and his family.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">“It means that I can look my children in the face and tell them that everything is possible,” Villegas said. “That if you follow your dreams, this could really happen.”</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Villegas hinted that this may not be the last time his group reinvents historic locations destined for demolition. He said he understands the impact Good Shepherd Lutheran Church had in the city, and hopes Foxtail On The Lake does the same in the building’s newest incarnation.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">“This congregation was a blessing for nearly 70 years in the city of Des Plaines,” Villegas said. “We look forward to being a blessing to the community through incredible memories that are built here for the next 70 years.”</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN">For more information on The Foxtail On The Lake, visit <b class=cXscX>thefoxtailonthelake.com</b>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnlJrAbrzLmqCnnaNitLC7w2aqoZ2gnbKzsIylrK2glaeur3nCoayrm5hiwbOtzaydqKqdmrFutc2tpmallZm2tbHRq5innZGjerOx0q2YrqqRo8FuwMeeZJ%2BnqKmuqriMqKVmrJiaeq2typ5kqKiVoK5w</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bobby-brown-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Bobby Brown Net Worth:Unraveling Bobby Browns Net Worth And Riches</span></a>
