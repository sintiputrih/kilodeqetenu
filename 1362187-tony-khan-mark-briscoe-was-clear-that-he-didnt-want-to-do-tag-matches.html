He also wrestled in a trios match on the Buy In ahead of AEW Revolution 2023.</p><p>During the media call ahead of <a href=#>ROH Supercard of Honor</a>, Khan stated that Mark does not want to do tag team matches anymore.</p><p>“Mark was very clear that he didn’t want to go back and do a tag match or be in tag matches,” Khan said. “He would do singles, trios, or multi-mans, but not do tag matches. That was something that made a lot of sense, and obviously, I want to do what makes Mark most comfortable. He was very comfortable with the idea of the Reach For The Sky ladder match.</p><p>“He’s been having great singles matches and, as a trio with the Lucha Brothers (Rey Fenix & Penta El Zero Miedo), has had exciting matches. There are a lot of opportunities for other great singles and trios matches and combinations with Mark.” (Transcription credit of Jeremy Lambert of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fightful</a>)</p><p>Mark Briscoe will challenge Samoa Joe for the ROH World Television Championship at ROH Supercard of Honor 2023.
