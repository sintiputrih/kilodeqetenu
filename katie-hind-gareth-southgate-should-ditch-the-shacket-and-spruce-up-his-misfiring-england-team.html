Standing in the Wembley rain and unable to motivate his team, he looked to the sky, dishevelled with the button undone.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>His fashion faux pas was mocked, like his on-pitch tactics. One Twitter user suggested he was trying to imitate rock band Oasis, saying: ‘Liam Gallagher could have made that work, definitely maybe, but not you.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Southgate’s Shacket is sold by London-based fashion label Percival Menswear at £199. It is one of many available on the high street, with Marks & Spencer and Next both selling their own designs.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Fashion blog Rydale brims with enthusiasm, saying: ‘More commonly known as a ‘summer jacket’ or ‘overshirt’, which is the ideal layering piece to keep the chill off for when the sun is setting, but still ensuring your styling is on point and you look like that summer babe you are.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A shacket also enables you to create more of a signature edgy style than a coat, but still keeps you just as warm.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Underneath, Southgate wore Percival’s Surrey Knit Cuban White Rib, on sale for £109. But he might want to reconsider the top if we later face Portugal – because it was made in that country.</p><img decoding=async id=i-fb4edc01b306eece src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/06/19/23/44437191-9704705-image-a-13_1624141177294.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="The England manager's waistcoat became the country's most-talked-about fashion item after the last World Cup" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p><img decoding=async id=i-fb4edc01b306eece src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/06/19/23/44437191-9704705-image-a-13_1624141177294.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="The England manager's waistcoat became the country's most-talked-about fashion item after the last World Cup" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p class=imageCaption>The England manager’s waistcoat became the country’s most-talked-about fashion item after the last World Cup</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Both items are part of the capsule collection Percival has provided to the England boss for the Euros.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In May, Southgate asked a member of his staff to contact the brand to request it dress him for the tournament.
