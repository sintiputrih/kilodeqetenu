Their relationship can be considered a real-life Hollywood fairytale. They had first met in 1998 in a set of Fox’s&nbsp;That 70s Show.</span></p><p><span>Then coincidentally, they reunited at the 69th Golden Globe Awards on 15 January 2012. After meeting up there, Ashton eventually invited Mila to his upcoming housewarming party in Hollywood Hills, where they shared their first obvious kiss.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><span>Being on-screen couple as Kelso and Jackie in That 70s Show, Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis officially dated in 2012.</span> They started hanging out with each other from the beginning of 2012, and in April of the same year, they started living together.</span></p><h3><span><strong>Mila Kunis Was 31 When She Was First Pregnant</strong></span></h3><p><span>Mila Kunis was first seen wearing her 5 carat Tiffany Solitaire diamond engagement ring worth $250,000 in February 2014, as per the reports by People. Then within a few months, Mila herself revealed her pregnancy on Ellen by hinting she had been craving sauerkraut and pickles throughout her pregnancy.</span></p><p><span>Then the couple welcomed their first baby daughter, Wyatt Isabelle Kutcher, on 1&nbsp;October 2014 at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles.</span></p><p><span>Wyatt Isabelle Kutcher is said to be extremely bright, smart, and intelligent. Ashton had revealed on a show that Wyatt started speaking three languages by the age of 2 and half years. He added, “she’s got like Russian and Spanish and English. She actually understands them.” He also said that Wyatt actually thinks the younger baby is her baby and is incredibly lovable and motherly towards her younger brother.</span></p><h3><span><strong>They Welcomed Second Baby After One Year Of Marriage</strong></span></h3><p><span>Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher finally tied the knot on 4 July 2015 after being costars, friends, friends with benefits, and parents. They got married in a private ceremony in Oak Glen, California.</span></p><p><span>The couple welcomed another baby child, and it was a son named Dimitri Portwood Kutcher, at the end of 2016.&nbsp;<span>The celebrity couple got talked about his walking ability because of his father, Ashton, always being spotted carrying him in his arms. Ashton once hilariously fired back when Ellen DeGeneres referred to his son as the young boy who never walked.</span></span></p><p><span>They were seen attending and walking the Red Carpet at the Breakthrough Prize Awards in 2017 after five years of being together.</span></p><p><span>The couple did a joint podcast interview and talked about parenting on 4&nbsp;March 2020.

They avoid using soap regularly on their children’s bodies and encourage them to wash their faces twice a day.</span></p><p><span>After being together on screen for a show, they had never worked together on any other projects. Still, recently, the celebrity couple appeared in a Cheetos Commercial for the 2021 super bowl.</span></p><h3><span><strong>Mila Kunis Didn't Want To Send Her Husband To Space</strong></span></h3><p><span>Ashton Kutcher had bought a ticket of $200,000 in 2012 for a trip to suborbital space on a Virgin Galactic flight founded by Richard Branson and his crew. At the time, Ashton wasn’t married and never had children, but when the time came for the trip, he had already started his family, and his wife Mila encouraged him to sell his ticket and cancel his trip because he had kids and family and realized that it was not a smart family decision.</span></p><h3><span><strong>They Both Had A Past Relationship History</strong></span></h3><p><span>Ashton was first married to actress Demi Moore with 15 years of an age gap and became a stepfather to her three children. Ashton then got divorced on 17 November 2011 after six years of being together.</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, Mila Kunis was in a relationship with famous former child star Macaulay Culkin from 2002, and she ended the relationship in 2011.</span></p><h2><strong><span>How Much Is Mila Kunis Net Worth?</span></strong></h2><p><span>According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Mila Kunis is regarded as a successful and established actress who has won a number of awards and has a net worth of $75 million.</span></p><p><span>The powerful Hollywood celebrity couple had their own periods of struggle at an early age and now became successful individuals living together in a custom-built Beverly Hills mansion, owning a garage of flashy cars, and have an investment portfolio full of the biggest and innovative companies.
