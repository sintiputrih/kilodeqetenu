During a candid interview on Miley Cyrus' Instagram Live chat show, <a href=#>Bright Minded</a>, in April 2020, Gomez revealed that she had discussed her condition with experts at McClean Hospital near Boston: "After years of going through a lot of different things, I realized that I was bipolar, and so when I go to know more information, it actually helps me," she said, before wisely adding, "It doesn't scare me once I know it, and I think people get scared of that, right?"</p><p>As it turns out, Gomez suspected that some of her family members suffer from the same mental disorder: "I've seen some of it even in my own family where I'm like, 'What's going on?' ... I'm from Texas, and it's not known to talk about your mental health."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2hka4R5e9KtmKurXay1sHnHmq2eZaKaw6aty56bZqyYmrazecGip6ikkad6pbXAoKWoq5mofA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jomon-woman.html><span>←</span><span>Scientists Reconstruct Ancient Japanese Woman Using Her Tooth</span></a>
