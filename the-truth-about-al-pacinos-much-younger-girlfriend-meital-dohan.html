Fans of the stage may have seen Dohan's Love and Sex on the High Holidays, which featured "well-known Israeli singer Ivri Lider," as well as Bath Party, which Dohan co-wrote and starred in.</p><p>If you can't make your way to one of Dohan's plays, then you can check out her writing in her first book, <a href=#>Love and Other Bad Habits</a>, which was published in Israel back in 2007. On her website, Dohan describes the book to potential readers as "visually and poetically stimulating ...&nbsp;a rare tapestry of feminine identity." Containing "texts and photos showing a diverse and honest representation of women removing their masks," the ladies on the pages include "Israeli figures, some of whom are publicly known and famous." The participants "poetically expose themselves, forming an intriguing outline of the feminine body and mind." Described as a book that focuses on "defiance, irony, the immortalization of feminine beauty, the conflict between the different roles of women in the modern world, and the expectations they need to meet," it might be your new favorite read.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmanBna4Vze9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2WuW68wJygp6ejYrq2r8dmsKitnpyys3nGoqmlnqKesq%2BwjKacoqyRoXqlu8eapWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./steve-howey-3.html><span>←</span><span>Steve Howey Age, Net Worth, Wife, Family, Parents and Biography</span></a>
