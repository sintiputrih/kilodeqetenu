<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Cristela Alonzo New UpComing Comedy Special Titled Middle Classy Is Set To Premiere On Netflix</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Cristela Alonzo’s forthcoming comedy special, Middle Classy, will release on Netflix on Tuesday, June 28, 2022, at 3 a.m. ET. It’ll be a follow-up to her 2017 comedy special Lower Classy. During the Netflix Is A Joke event, the comedian already revealed her next special.</p><p>The comedian allegedly remarked over the phone:</p><p>“It all started while I was composing ‘Lower Classy,’ and I was barely breaking into this new level of existence.” Being able to care for oneself is a whole other level than simply getting by, and it was a lesson I had to learn. That is the distinction between Lower Classy and Middle Classy.”</p><p>Cristela Alonzo: Middle Classy, directed by Paige Hurwitz and produced by Wanda Sykes’ Push It Productions, will feature the 43-year-old Alonzo addressing issues like her family, aging, and her first visit to the gynecologist. The Texas-born, Los Angeles-based comedian has recounted her family’s troubles growing up in poverty.&nbsp;This time, Alonzo quips that after dedicating herself to stand-up comedy for two decades, she has successfully moved to the middle class.</p><h2>More information about Cristela Alonzo and her forthcoming comedy special Middle Classy</h2><p>Alonzo, who hails from a poor background, will talk about the new middle-class “luxuries” she can purchase after years of working in the stand-up comedy profession. She modestly quips about the things she can now afford, such as dental care, health insurance, and therapy.&nbsp;According to Netflix, the official summary of Middle Classy is as follows:</p><p>“Comedian Cristela Alonzo spills the beans about learning English from ‘The Price Is Right,’ receiving COVID for her birthday, and how money can indeed buy happiness.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cristela-Alonzo-3.jpg alt="Cristela Alonzo" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The Latina allegedly said regarding her mental health and treatment sessions:</p><p>“‘If you have a medical condition, like high blood pressure, you take medication for it,’ added the psychiatrist. So why wouldn’t you do something like that for your mental health? Your mental wellness is just as important as your physical health.’ That simplicity made me understand how long I had avoided it because my family had avoided it.”</p><p>She continued, saying:</p><p>“I started taking medicine, and my life has entirely transformed to the point that I can appreciate and value happiness in a new manner. I wanted to inform everyone about it since there are so many people who cannot afford it, but there are organizations that may assist them. If you can afford it, I want to encourage people to seek assistance and to give it a try because it works.”</p><p>Alonzo has twice made history. The first came with the debut of Cristela in 2014, which made her the first Latina to create, produce, and star in her own comedy series. The second time she appeared as the main character in a Disney Pixar film was when she voiced Cruz Ramirez in Cars 3.&nbsp;His Dark Materials and The Upshaws are two of the comedian’s most recent acting roles. She also hosted the inaugural season of The CW’s Legends of the Hidden Temple.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cristela-Alonzo-2.jpg alt="Cristela Alonzo" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She said in the same interview:</p><p>“I haven’t been the first in this business, but it’s strange to think about how many firsts we still have to produce.” The thing about being the first is that you want to show others that it does not have to be the last.”</p><p>Alonzo’s new stand-up comedy show Middle Classy was filmed in January at the Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts in Beverly Hills, and it will air internationally on Netflix on Tuesday, June 28, 2022.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiaq6GjqbKtrYyao6imqqR6r7HWZqypm5%2Bitq%2BzjJympp2Urnq0vMScoJqkXam2tbjEnWSmoZSZuaZ5wqWYrKupYra0edKeq2asn2K9s7HMopyrnV2ku266xK2dpaGoZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-victor-vespa-from-american-pickers-season-24.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Victor Vespa from American Pickers season 24?</span></a>
