Read on below to find out more.</p><h3>What Baba Vanga got wrong</h3><h4>Designer babies</h4><p>The clairvoyant reportedly predicted the creation of "designer babies" that are grown in laboratories, with parents being able to select their physical traits.</p><p>In December last year, biotechnologist Hashem Al-Ghaili released a video that presented a lab that was reportedly able to "incubate up to 30,000 lab-grown babies per year".</p><p>This project, dubbed Ectolife, is yet to exist in the world, but those troubled by genetic engineering do have reason to be worried as the facility's as-of-yet hypothetical "Elite Package" allows parents to "edit any trait of [their] baby through a wide range of over 300 genes".</p><p>Baba's prediction, then, is worryingly plausible – but not quite correct.</p><h3 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border publication-font brand-bg">Top Trending Stories Today</h3><h4>Devesta<span></span>ting nuclear disaster</h4><p>Baba Vanga is also said to have predicted a major nuclear plant explosion this year, that would see toxic gas settle over Asia.</p><p>Thankfully, 2023 hasn't seen any such event – but with a month still to go, there is still time for a nuclear disaster similar to Chernobyl in 1986.</p><p>The climate crisis is also continuing to worsen, as "toxic clouds" - albeit not nuclear ones - are beginning to develop in some parts of Asia.</p><h3>What Baba Vanga got right</h3><h4>A calamitous solar storm</h4><p>Baba believed that a solar storm would rock the globe this year. A solar storm occurs when disturbances on the sun emit solar flares and large clouds of highly magnetised plasma, interfering with the Earth's own magnetic field.</p><p>And on December 1, State forecasters warned that a massive solar storm was due to hit Earth, causing radio, internet, and GPS fluctuations.</p><span class=factbox-header><h3>Join the Daily Record WhatsApp community!</h3></span><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article31220010.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_IMG_0001JPG.jpg><p>Get the latest news sent straight to your messages by joining our WhatsApp community today.</p><p>You'll receive daily updates on breaking news as well as the top headlines across Scotland.</p><p>No one will be able to see who is signed up and no one can send messages except the Daily Record team.</p><p>All you have to do is <a href=# rel=nofollow><b>click here if you're on mobile</b></a>, select 'Join Community' and you're in!</p><p>If you're on a desktop, simply scan the QR code above with your phone and click 'Join Community'.</p><p>We also treat our community members to special offers, promotions, and adverts from us and our partners.
