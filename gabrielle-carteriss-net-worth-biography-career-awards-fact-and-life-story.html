Gabrielle Carteris was born on January 2, 1961 in Scottsdale, Arizona with her twin brother, James.</p><p>Carteris’ mother eventually moved with her children to San Francisco, California, where she set up a children’s clothing store. While attending high school in Marin County, California, Gabrielle took an interest in the arts, studying ballet. She graduated from Sarah Lawrence College in 1983 with a bachelor’s degree in Liberal Arts. Carteris’ early television career found her typically cast as a teenager in “ABC Afterschool Specials”, “CBS Schoolbreak Special”, and the long-running soap opera “Another World”. This trend of playing significantly younger would continue when, in 1990, Carteris was cast in her best known role as studious school newspaper editor Andrea Zuckerman on “Beverly Hills, 90210”. At age 29, she was the oldest cast member to portray a 16-year-old. Carteris left the series in 1995 and became the host of her own television talk show, entitled “Gabrielle”, which lasted only one season. She married stockbroker Charles Isaacs in 1992, and has two daughters with him named Kelsey Rose and Mollie Elizabeth.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJ%2BRl7%2BqsculnGabkafBpr7IrKpmppWperi70a2fZpqZpLSzrc%2BhsGabkaeypr6Mmq6aqpSoeqetwq1kmqaUYrmqssRmqq2noq58</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./corey-stoll-strain-wig-homeland-chat-html.html><span>←</span><span>Corey Stoll on His Wig Journey and The Strains Gross Filming Conditions</span></a>
