Gabby, 19, took on “Little Red Wagon,” “Rivers Deep,” and “Don’t Stop Believin,’” the last in which <a href=#><strong>Luke Bryan</strong></a> called “the most amazing version [he’s] ever heard.” Maddie, 20, rounded out the final three, performing “Landslide,” “Going Going Gone” and “Don’t Ever Let Your Children Grow Up.” The last brought tears to many eyes in the house – and viewers’ houses, too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/american-idol-judges.jpg><p>During the finale, <a href=#><strong>Luke Bryan</strong></a> performed his hit song “Most People Are Good” with Gabby. Meanwhile, finalist Maddie got to perform with another stud: <strong>Kermit the Frog</strong>. Caleb joined <strong>Darius Rucker</strong> for a country duet of “Wagon Wheel.” The final three also all joined together with <a href=#><strong>Bebe Rexha</strong></a> to sing “Meant To Be.”</p><p>Later, a must-see duet took place: top 10 finalist <strong>Lala Spring</strong> and her little sister, <strong>Dyxie</strong>, performed <a href=#><strong>LeAnn Rimes</strong></a>’ hit song “Blue.” They were absolutely shocked when Rimes herself came out and joined them.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>OMG. <a href=#>@leannrimes</a> surprising <a href=#>@laylaspring</a> and Dyxie was the best! <a href=#>#AmericanIdol</a> <a href=#>#IdolFinale</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/HnICrDNvu5</a></p><p>— American Idol (@AmericanIdol) <a href=#>May 22, 2018</a></p><p>That was followed by <a href=#><strong>Katy Perry</strong></a> performing with another top 10 finalist, <strong>Catie Turner</strong>.
