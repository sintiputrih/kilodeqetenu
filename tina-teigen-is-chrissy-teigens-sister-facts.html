There’s barely any news about who her real father is even as both mother and daughter(s) have kept that really private and away from wondering minds.</p><p>How Tina Teigen manages to keep a relatively low profile is quite strange to many fans who got to find out later, about the ‘lesser-famous Teigen’ as she is often referred to.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Unknown_Facts_About_Tina_Teigen></span><strong>Unknown Facts About Tina Teigen</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/jukebugs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Tina-Teigen-e1602835048623.jpg><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=1_Tina_was_single-handedly_raised_by_her_mother_during_her_early_years></span><strong>1.

Moreover, nothing is known about Tina’s biological father as she was officially adopted by Ron and bears his name to date.</p><p>While Tina won’t share much about her family on social media, Chrissy is one to share a lot and from all indications, she is very close to her sister. Asides from teasing her sister on her page, Chrissy also shares adorable pictures of her niece -Pasha on her page. All we can say is ‘this is definitely a close-knit family.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=3_Cooking_seems_to_be_a_similar_family_trait_as_Tina_like_her_mother_and_sister_is_also_a_wonderful_cook></span><strong>3. Cooking seems to be a similar family trait as Tina like her mother and sister is also a wonderful cook</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Chrissy Teigen is the author of 2 New York best sellers cookbook. She adapted some of her mother’s Thai recipes for her cookbooks and has commented that her mother is always in the kitchen cooking. While working on her cookbook titled Cravings: Hungry for More, she posted a tweet teasing her sister how long it took her to make Nam Khao rice for the book because she was ‘high’.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=4_Tina_likes_to_keep_her_private_life_away_from_social_media></span><strong>4. Tina likes to keep her private life away from social media</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>While Chrissy seems to relish every bit of the attention that comes with being a celebrity, Tina prefers to stay away from the spotlight. Tina doesn’t have much presence on social media and has kept most of her accounts private.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=5_Tina_Teigen_was_married_but_is_now_divorced></span><strong>5. Tina Teigen was married but is now divorced</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In 2014, Tina married <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Corey Speaks</a> who is a motivational speaker. Things seem to have been great with the duo as they welcomed their first child together -Pasha in October 2014. Not long after, their relationship and marriage hit the rock and the couple went their separate ways.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=6_Tina_Teigen_and_ex-husband_have_been_able_to_maintain_a_healthy_relationship_while_co-parenting_their_daughter></span><strong>6. Tina Teigen and ex-husband have been able to maintain a healthy relationship while co-parenting their daughter</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>From all indications, the former couple seems to have put all their differences behind them to prioritize raising their daughter together in a healthy environment. They live across the street from each other in Vegas, vacation together as a family, share the same nanny, and have family dinner together four nights a week.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=7_Her_daughter_is_a_budding_social_media_star_just_like_her_aunty_Chrissy></span><strong>7. Her daughter is a budding social media star just like her aunty Chrissy</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Despite keeping her account private and not being a social media person herself, Tina has been very liberal when it comes to her daughter. She opened an Instagram for her as a baby (December 29th, 2014) where all her over 5,000 followers have been privileged to watch her grow.</p><p>Asides from sharing adorable pictures of Pasha on vacations, at parties, in school, with friends, and of course her cousins (Luna and Miles), the feisty Pasha herself is beginning to get more involved on the page as she grows. After Chrissy and John lost their baby in September, Pasha wrote a handwritten note that read <strong>“Sore That you Lost your baby, Love Pasha”</strong> in a post where she tagged her aunty.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=8_Tina_enjoys_a_close_relationship_with_her_mother_and_sister></span><strong>8. Tina enjoys a close relationship with her mother and sister</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Tina isn’t really the type to share on social media and Chrissy probably respects her sister’s boundaries and doesn’t overshare about Tina’s life. Mothers, on the other hand, do not understand these boundaries and we have been able to glean from their mother’s Instagram account, just how close the three Teigen girls are.</p><p>From a December 2017 post, Tina and Chrissy posed together in matching hats on a luxury jet on their way for a vacation. There are several posts of them hanging out, drinking, and partying together. They also enjoy cooking and relaxing together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/jukebugs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/chrissy-teigen-sister-tina-1559937186937.png><p>Tina also was very supportive of her mum and dad’s decision to divorce and she provided whatever help her mum needed as at the time her stepfather filed for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">divorce</a> in 2019. The divorce was finalized by 2020 and Tina was there for her parents through the process.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=9_Tv_Appearance></span><strong>9. Tv Appearance</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tina Teigen was on Celebrity Family Feud</a> Tv game show hosted by Steve Harvey, in June 2019. A few months before the show, her sister Chrissy had announced that she was going to be on the show with her mother and sister and although we expected the whole Teigen family, it was also alright to feel skeptical about expecting Tina on the show as she is not one to always want to be in the public eye.</p><p>To the pleasure of fans and audience, Tina made up the required number of family members for the game show. She was present to support her sister and indeed the whole family. She played the game alongside her sister Chrissy, her mum, John, and his elder brother and she obviously had so much fun while at it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/jukebugs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Teigen-Legend-e1624453082555.jpg><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=10_What_exactly_does_Tina_do_for_a_living></span><strong>10. What exactly does Tina do for a living?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>As stated earlier, Tina is a very private person who has chosen not to share much about herself with the media.

She splits her time between parenting, family time, (as she has an extremely close-knit family), philanthropy, and craft cocktails.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Meet All of Jon Bon Jovi’s Children- Who They Are, Love Life</a></strong></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=11_Tina_Teigen_is_very_passionate_about_charity_and_philanthropy></span><strong>11.
