The Mormon Church distanced itself from plural marriage around 1890, but some Moron fundamentalists still practice polygamy today. By the late 1960s, Ervil — sometimes called the “Mormon Manson” — formed a fundamentalist sect unaffiliated with the mainstream Mormon church called the Church of the First Born of the Lamb of God.</p><p data-characters=198 data-current-count=198 data-injectable=false>Shortly after, the murders linked to LeBaron started, and members of the LeBaron family were often targeted.

One of LeBaron’s kids, Anna LeBaron, escaped and wrote about her experience with the murderous fundamentalist leader in her book, The Polygamist’s Daughter: A Memoir. Anna also contributed to the 2024 Hulu series Daughters of the Cult.</p><p data-characters=276 data-current-count=276 data-injectable=false>Speaking with the <a href=#>BBC</a> the year her book came out, Anna said, “We were taught that we were celestial children, having been born from the prophet Ervil LeBaron.

Allred, another extremist, off-shoot Mormon sect leader. In 1981, however, LeBaron died by suicide while serving his sentence at age 56. He left behind orders for his family and followers to continue to murder in his name, including the now infamous “4 O’Clock Murders” in Texas in 1988. As many as 50 murders are linked to Ervil and his family, among other crimes such as bank robbery, drug and gun trafficking, and the rampant sexual and physical abuse of women and girls.</p><p data-characters=159 data-current-count=159 data-injectable=false>Daughters of the Cult from ABC News Studios is a five-part <strong><a href=#>true crime</a></strong> documentary series about LeBaron, his family, and crimes expected Jan. 4, 2024, on Hulu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekp8KmecKroKadX528uHnMmqWyZZOdtq2w0Z6lZpyZmXqmvtWio2aklZeus7vNZp2rp51isaLBxqGrnqqjYrynedOhnGabpaHBbrTAr5xmmZ6Zeqm71mabopxdnbJusMieZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gerald-j-ford-net-worth-276487.html><span>←</span><span>Gerald J.
