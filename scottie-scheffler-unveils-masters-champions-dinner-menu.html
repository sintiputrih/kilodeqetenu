The tradition, which has been held since 1952, sees past winners gather together to celebrate the champion, with Augusta National chairman Fred Ridley the only non-member who will attend.
Scheffler cruised to victory in last year’s tournament by three shots over Rory McIlroy. However, before his thoughts turn to defending his trophy, he will host the dinner from a menu he has curated."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
