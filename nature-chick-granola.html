Yes I am. I know it’s confusing because I just ate four chocolate chip cookies but it’s all about moderation, right?”</p><p>So clearly I had to name something after that childhood nickname – and here’s just the perfect thing for it!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/DSC_0511ed3.jpg alt="Nature Chick Granola" width=3890 height=2983 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Granola gets a bad rap. You’ve heard the complaints – too much sugar or too much fat. I wanted to create a recipe that doesn’t have any refined sugars and just the good for you all-natural stuff. By using fresh squeezed orange juice (or any 100% pure orange juice in stores), real maple syrup (from real trees), and creamy honey (from real bees – ha!), it will give you incredible energy.</p><p>My mother-in-law knows more about health than anyone I know. She studies books and articles on the internet all day long and you should see her pantry! It’s a health food store. Years ago when I was visiting, I freaked out because there was no sugar in sight. I rummaged through her cabinets and found some chocolate protein powder and I ate it by the spoonful…I kid you not. Pathetic I know. She has her kids to eating coconut oil by the spoonful. I won’t go that far but I don’t have any guilt using it in this granola. It’s a good for you fat which is a bonus. If you aren’t a coconut oil fan, you can substitute canola oil.</p><p>One of the greatest aspects of this granola is the versatility. &nbsp;If you don’t like dried apricots, it’s okay. Leave them out. If you don’t like sunflower seeds, get rid of them. It’s okay if you are picky. It’s okay. You can tailor make this granola to be chock full of everything you love. If you want to add dark chocolate, be my guest.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/DSC_0215ed1.jpg alt="Nature Chick Granola" width=4608 height=3072 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>For breakfast, you can take a bowl of fresh greek yogurt (or almond/coconut yogurt), drizzle it with honey, top it with fresh raspberries (or any berry), and a place a generous sprinkle of this <strong>Nature Chick Granola</strong>. It’s a hearty breakfast that will keep you satisfied + happy for hours.</p><p>This is an excellent topping on the <span><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Antioxidant Power Acai Smoothie Bowls</a>.</strong></span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/DSC_0215edcr1.jpg alt="Nature Chick Granola" width=2248 height=2232 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p class=block-pinterest-cta__title>Pin this now to find it later</p><a href=# title="Share on Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class=wp-element-button data-postid=430 data-pin-do=none data-social-network=Pinterest data-social-action=Pin data-social-target=https://www.modernhoney.com/nature-chick-granola/>Pin It</a><ul class=wprm-recipe-instructions readability=9><li id=wprm-recipe-12444-step-0-0 class=wprm-recipe-instruction readability=-1><p>Preheat oven to 300 degrees.</p></li><li id=wprm-recipe-12444-step-0-1 class=wprm-recipe-instruction readability=8><p>Place oats, coconut, nuts, and seeds in large bowl.
