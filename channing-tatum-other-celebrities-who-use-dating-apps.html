Many are able to meet someone the old fashioned way, without the use of social media or any other technology. On the other hand, we all know that dating can be hard, especially when you’re a celebrity, which is why many of us — including celebrities — turn to dating apps to give us a little bit of a boost. That’s right — there are plenty of celebrities on dating apps, you just have to find them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Celebrity Couples Reveal How They Kept Their Marriages Alive After Difficult Times</a></span></p><p>Dating apps can be both a blessing and a curse when it comes to finding love. Believe it or not, there are quite a few celebrities who have found the one on dating apps, while others learned the hard way. Luckily for celebrities, when Tinder fails, they always have the exclusive celebrity dating app, Raya. Regardless, the possibilities are endless for celebrities who are trying to find love, they just have to find the right match.</p><h2 id=ryan-lochte><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Ryan Lochte</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Olympic swimmer Ruan Lochte is no stranger to using dating apps. In fact, he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">met his wife</a> on one. Back in the day, it was no secret that Ryan was a fan of using dating apps and especially liked using Tinder. The two instantly clicked as they both swiped right and the rest is history.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Surprising Ways These Hollywood Couples Met For The First Time</a></span></p><p>It was easy for the two of them as they started dating and Ryan later proposed. The two later married in 2018 and went on to have two beautiful daughters together, Caiden and Liv. Ryan is proof that dating apps can really work out sometimes.</p><h2 id=drew-barrymore><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Drew Barrymore</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately for <a href=#>Drew Barrymore</a>, she really didn't have a great experience with a dating app as she was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stood up</a>. According to Drew, she started talking to someone on a dating app that she didn't name, and things were going smoothly so they decided to go out on a date. Sadly, when it came time for the date, Drew went to meet up with the guy, however, he never met up with her. Instead, he stood her up.&nbsp;Because of this bad date, it really turned her off from wanting to continue to use dating apps.</p><h2 id=adam-rippon><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Adam Rippon</span></h2><p><a href=#>Adam Rippon</a> has conquered so much during his career — he made it to the Olympics where he won a bronze medal in figure skating, but he was also the first openly gay man to represent the USA. And now, he's conquered dating apps. In 2018, Adam <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">started dating</a> Jussi-Pekka Kajaala all thanks to swiping right on Tinder.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>These Celebrity Couples Were Engaged, But Never Got Married</a></span></p><p>Recently, the two got engaged when Adam went to spend time with his boyfriend in Finland where he lives. The two had been separated for a long time due to the pandemic. Adam is yet another prime example of dating apps working out in the end.</p><h2 id=zac-efron><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Zac Efron</span></h2><p>It's no secret that most of us were crushed when <a href=#>Zac Efron</a> and Vanessa Hudgens broke up as we thought they were destined to be together. These days, Zac is having a hard time dating and even tried jumping into the world of dating apps. Zac admitted that he tried <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">using Tinder</a> for a while, however, no one ever swiped right on him because they didn't believe it was him, and instead, a fake profile. He might have a better time on the celebrity dating app Raya, instead.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sam-smith><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Sam Smith</span></h2><p><a href=#>Sam Smith</a> had a similar excuse on dating apps as Zac Efron did. Sam admitted that they recently downloaded the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hinge app</a>, and tried to find some love of their own. Unfortunately, they didn't get very far as they were kicked off of the dating app. Sam was kicked off of the app because they thought that he was a fraud and it was someone just trying to be Sam. Maybe Sam should try Tinder where they can be verified to prove that it is them, or even try to apply to use the celebrity dating app, Raya.</p><h2 id=rebel-wilson><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Rebel Wilson</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Rebel Wilson</a> is yet another celebrity who has turned to dating apps to find love. Rebel has admitted that she has used the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">celebrity dating app</a>, Raya, but hasn't had much luck with it. She’s only been on the app when she’s been single, checking out who else is on there and trying to make a connection. She hasn’t had much luck, though. Finding that dating can be extremely intimidating and difficult and that it’s hard for her to find someone who doesn’t intimidate her, despite the fact that she plays such a confident character on screen.</p><h2 id=bethenny-frankel><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Bethenny Frankel</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Bethenny Frankel</a> is a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">success story</a> when it comes to using a dating app to find love. Currently the former Real Housewife is engaged to her fiancé Paul Bernon. She proudly admits that she met Paul all thanks to a dating app that she decided to take a chance on. Although she was scared to meet him in person at first, she was glad that she went for it as he was everything she’d hope he be and more. Although the pandemic has delayed their plans to get married, Bethenny and Paul are happy to take their time and go at their own pace.</p><h2 id=sharon-stone><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Sharon Stone</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Sharon Stone</a> is another celebrity who has admitted to using a dating app. However, she wasn't as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">lucky</a> as others. Out of all the dating apps out there, Sharon opted to use Bumble. Unfortunately, Sharon was locked out of her account on the app rather quickly as users were reporting her profile as someone who was catfishing others, when in reality, it was actually Sharon. Luckily Bumble made things right and gave her account back, and Sharon is back on Bumble&nbsp;again.</p><h2 id=laverne-cox><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Laverne Cox</span></h2><p><a href=#>Laverne Cox</a> found love when it came to using a dating app, however, it <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">didn't last</a>. The actress decided that she wanted to try her hand on a dating app, and opted to use Tinder. Things worked in her favor as she swiped right on a guy that swiped right on her too. The two immediately hit it off, and we’re together for quite a few months. Unfortunately, things between them didn’t really work out as the broke up not long after. Maybe we’ll be seeing Laverne back on Tinder sooner rather than later.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=channing-tatum><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Channing Tatum</span></h2><p>If you're lucky enough to get on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Raya</a>, you might just find <a href=#>Channing Tatum</a>. As we know Channing hasn’t been terribly lucky in the love department as he divorced his wife Jenna Dewan and recently broke up with his girlfriend Jessie J. Since he’s back on the market, Channing is giving dating apps a try, especially the app that’s exclusively for celebrities, Raya. For those who have had the opportunity to find him on the exclusive app, he has a very cheeky bio that says: “and yes, I used to be a stripper. Sorry!”</p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>These Current And Former Celebrity Couples Started Dating 10 Years Ago</a></span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaoZmeo7avs4ytmK2tnWK8tbTEq2ScnZyar7O106KcrGWnnbxuwdKeZJ2ZpJ67qHnAqaesZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./barry-van-dyke.html><span>←</span><span>Barry Van Dyke: American Actor, Movies &amp;amp; TV Shows, Age, Wife, Children, Now, Net Worth, Wiki!</span></a>
