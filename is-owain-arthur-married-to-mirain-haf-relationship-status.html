And this time, he’s portraying “Prince Durin IV” in </span><i><span>Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power</span></i><span>. But as much as we’re excited to see him in the new Amazon Prime Video series, we’re also curious about what happened to his relationship with Mirain Haf. Are they married? If not, what’s Owain’s relationship status today?</span></p><p><span>Well, these are the question we’ll be answering below.</span></p><h3><b>Is Owain Arthur Married To Mirain Haf?</b></h3><p><span>Sadly, no, Owain Arthur isn’t married to Mirain Haf. The duo broke up soon after their engagement in 2009.</span></p><p><span>But looking back, the ex-lovers did seem like they were meant to last forever. From their overlapping career to their identical sense of humor, everything seemed picture-perfect.</span></p><p><span>Fortunately, the year they got engaged, the duo even had the chance to share the screen on S4C’s </span><i><span>Cei Bach</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>“We had a lot of fun filming the series,” Owain recalled. And given that the characters were very colorful and the plots are very funny, the duo admittedly had a hard time keeping straight faces. “Owain and I had to film one scene repeatedly because we were laughing so much,” Mirain added.</span></p><p><span>For those who haven’t watched the series, Owain plays a village policeman, and his wife, Mari is played by Mirain Haf who kept a small hotel near the quayside. Overall, the series weaves stories about the life of a policeman and events in the hotel and the community.</span></p><p><span>Prior to </span><i><span>Cei Bach</span></i><span>, Owain and Mirain also together appeared in </span><i><span>Rownd a Rownd</span></i><span> for a couple of years.</span></p><p><span>For those who don’t know who Owain’s ex-fiancee is, Mirain is an actress who portrayed “Ellie” on </span><i><span>Dim Ond y Gwir</span></i><span> (2015). Also, she’s a “furniture upcycler” who sold her hand-painted rescued furniture on her Etsy account @</span><a href=#><span>MporiumMirain</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Also, find her on Instagram @</span><a href=#><span>mirsahaf</span></a><span> and Twitter @</span><a href=#><span>MirsiHaf</span></a><span>.</span></p><h3><b>Owain Arthur Relationship Status Today</b></h3><p><span>Owain Arthur is likely single today (as of 2022). Also, since his split from Mirain, he never once sparked a dating rumor.</span></p><p><span>As for Mirain (according to “Marriedwike.com”), she went on to marry Jak Poore on October 12, 2019 — a little over a year after their engagement. And it seems she’s retired from the acting world as well.</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, Owain kept continuing her career, and today, he’s a permanent cast on </span><i><span>Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>Delighted to portray Prince Durin IV (a prince of the Dwarven city Khazad-dûm and an old friend of Elrond), Owain shared that he was sure fans will enjoy the diversity within the </span><i><span>Lord of the Rings</span></i><span> spin-off. “It will open that up to the rest of the world and that they can see themselves up there and identify with it and feel represented, which I’m immensely proud to be a part of,” he further explained.</span></p><p><span>Also, he added that they hoped “with this retelling of the Legendarium” people will get “plugged in and locked into this new bunch of stories.”</span></p><h3><b>Owain Arthur Net Worth</b></h3><p><span>Owain Arthur garnered a net worth of under $1 million by 2022.</span></p><p><span>This Welsh actor started his acting journey in Bangor, Wales, filming the S4C series </span><i><span>Rownd a Rownd</span></i><span>, whilst also attending the performing arts school, </span><i><span>Ysgol Glanaethw</span></i><span>. He then trained at the </span><i><span>Guildhall School of Music and Drama</span></i><span> in Londo, and before he knew it he had multiple theater credits to his name including </span><i><span>Romeo and Juliet</span></i><span> for the </span><i><span>Royal Shakespeare Company</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Comedy of Errors</span></i><span> at the </span><i><span>Royal Exchange Theatre, </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Birdsong </span></i><span>at the </span><i><span>Comedy Theatre</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>However, it wasn’t until 2007 that he stepped into the TV screen playing “PC Vincent Kelly” in </span><i><span>Doctors</span></i><span>. Thereafter, he appeared in movies and TV shows like</span><i><span> The Palace </span></i><span>(2008), </span><i><span>Mr. Nice</span></i><span> (2010), </span><i><span>Babylon </span></i><span>(2014), </span><i><span>Dim Ond y Gwir</span></i><span> (2015), </span><i><span>35 Diwrnod </span></i><span>(2017), </span><i><span>Hard Sun</span></i><span> (2018), </span><i><span>Casualty</span></i><span> (2018), </span><i><span>A Confession</span></i><span> (2019), </span><i><span>The One and Only Ivan</span></i><span> (2020), and many more.</span></p><p><span>Also, Owain is a voice-over actor who voiced “Lofty” in the 2018 video game </span><i><span>Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom</span></i><span>.</span></p><h3><b>How Old Is Owain Arthur?</b></h3><p><span>Owain Arthur was born on March 5, 1983.
