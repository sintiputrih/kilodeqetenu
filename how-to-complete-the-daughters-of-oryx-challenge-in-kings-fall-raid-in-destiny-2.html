You and your fireteam can take on the most challenging encounters in this raid, earning phenomenal rewards. For those who want to go the extra mile and unlock the Kingslayer title, you will need to complete unique challenges in each boss encounter. You must complete the Under Construction challenge for the Daughters of Oryx. This guide covers how to complete the Daughters of Oryx challenge in King’s Fall Raid for Destiny 2.</p><h2>How to complete the Under Construction Challenge</h2><p data-injection=true>The standard encounter featuring the Daughters of Oryx will have players standing on glowing plates in the room’s four corners. The real fight starts when a player kills a Taken Knight standing on one of these plates, forcing a player to get thrown into another plane of existence. Two people must stand on the plates to activate platforms for the player who has been Taken to reach the buff at the top of the room. For the Under Construction challenge, your teammates must ensure they do not stand on the same plate during this encounter.</p><p><strong>Related</strong>: <a href=#>How to complete the Golgoroth Challenge in King’s Fall Raid in Destiny 2</a></p><p data-injection=true>The best way to get around this challenge is through communication. Whenever a teammate has already stood on a plate, make sure they rotate somewhere in the room to ensure they are not close to that plate, and they can take another to assist your team. Other players will need to make sure they’re close to plates that players have already used to double-check they have those locations covered.</p><p>However, the Daughters of Oryx is one of the easier challenges for players to complete. It’s an encounter that normally only takes two damage phases to defeat them. This will likely make it easier to finish this challenge before moving on to Oryx, but between each damage phase, there are six plates your team needs to stand on, for a total of 12 plates if you defeat a daughter during each phase. It will be important to keep track of how who has gone where and to watch the timer before the daughters unleash their song, wiping the party.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/17c418c90324bdc0fbd0bc2ce42fdf32?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Zack Palm</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>Zack Palm is the Senior Writer of Gamepur and has spent over five years covering video games, and earned a Bachelor's degree in Economics from Oregon State University.
