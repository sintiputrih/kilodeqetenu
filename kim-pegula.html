<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Kim Pegula</h1></header><section class=post-content><h3>Kim Pegula is a well-known businesswoman in the United States. Kim Pegula is well known for founding the NFL’s Buffalo Bills.</h3><h2>What is the Net Worth of Kim Pegula in 2021?</h2><p>Kim has undoubtedly amassed a sizable fortune as an entrepreneur. She is predicted to have a net worth of <strong>$100 million</strong> dollars as of 2021.</p><h2>Early Life and Childhood:</h2><p>Kim Pegula was born on June 7, 1969, as Kim S. Pegula. She was born in the city of Seoul, South Korea. She is an American citizen because she spent her professional life in the United States. Similarly, she will be 52 years old in 2021. She was also born under the sign of Gemini and comes from a Christian family.</p><p>Moving on to her relatives, there is no specific information about her biological parents. One of her parents is likely to be Japanese, according to one of her DNA tests. Ralph and Marilyn Kerr adopted her and brought her to the United States in December 1974. As a result, she spent her youth with her adopted family in Fairport, New York.</p><h2>Education:</h2><p>In terms of her educational background, she attended Houghton College. She was a cheerleader and a bassoonist in the school band when she was in school.</p><h2>Professional Life and Career:</h2><p>Pegula worked for East Resources, her husband’s company, from 1991 to 2010, when it was sold. The Pegulas bought the Buffalo Sabres and their two affiliated teams, the Buffalo Bandits of the NLL and the Rochester Americans of the AHL, shortly after. She had an influence on the design and construction of LECOM Harborcenter, a mixed-use development adjacent to the Sabres’ arena that is part of the city’s revitalization. Following the death of longtime Buffalo Bills owner Ralph Wilson, the football franchise was put up for sale.</p><p>Real estate billionaire (and future US President) Donald Trump, a group fronted by rock musician Jon Bon Jovi, and prominent members of Toronto-based Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment were also bidding for the franchise. In the end, the Pegulas won with an all-cash bid of $1.4 billion, a new NFL record.</p><p>Following the acquisition, Kim and Terry Pegula merged their sports franchises, as well as their record label Black River Entertainment, into a new firm, Pegula Sports and Entertainment. She’s also involved with the NFL Foundation, where she helped promote the “One Buffalo” concept. The Pegulas have also financially supported their alma maters, including a $12 million gift to Houghton College that allowed the institution to build a new athletics complex and move up to NCAA Division III.</p><p>Pegula, a dessert connoisseur, helped design “One Buffalo” premium ice cream and cupcake products. Since its creation, Pegula Sports and Entertainment, led by Kim Pegula, has acquired many properties in Buffalo and formed MSG Western New York, a regional sports network. The firm owned the Buffalo Beauts of the National Women’s Hockey League (until the franchise was sold a year later) and the Rochester Knighthawks of the National Lacrosse League.</p><h3>More Details:</h3><p>In March 2018, she was named to the National Football League’s business ventures committee, following Russ Brandon. Pegula is also a member of the NFL’s Super Bowl and major-event advisory committees.</p><p>On May 1, 2018, she was named president of all Pegula Sports and Entertainment businesses. After becoming the president of the Buffalo Bills and Buffalo Sabres, she became the first female team president in both the NFL and NHL. Among the few female NFL owners are Sheila Ford Hamp (Detroit Lions), Virginia Halas McCaskey (Chicago Bears), Amy Adams Strunk (Tennessee Titans), Carol Davis (Las Vegas Raiders), Denise DeBartolo York (San Francisco 49ers), Gayle Benson (New Orleans Saints), Janice McNair (Houston Texans), and Janice McNair (Houston Texans).</p><h2>Relationship Status:</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kim-with-her-husband-Terry-228x300.jpg><p>In terms of her marital status, she is currently married to her husband Terry Pegula. Terry is a multibillionaire businessman from the United States. In 1993, they tied the knot. In truth, she is Terry’s second wife. Kem has three children from this marriage, one of them is Jessica Pegula, a well-known professional tennis player. She is also the stepmother of Terry’s children from his former marriage, Michael and Laura.</p><h2>Body Measurements and Social Media:</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kim-posing-for-a-photo-300x300.jpg><p>There is no reliable information on how to improve her physical measurements.

Due to her daily fitness exercises, it appears that she is over 50 years old. Her hair is also black, and she has black eyes.</p><p>She uses her social media accounts and is active on them.
