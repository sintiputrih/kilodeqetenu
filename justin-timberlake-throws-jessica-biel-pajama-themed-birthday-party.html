In one of the photos, the longtime loves are shown smiling from ear to ear as they hold each other close.</p><p>“Celebrating my birthday in style… and by that I mean, in pajamas,” the Sinner executive producer captioned her post on Tuesday, March 3. “I made Justin PROMISE not to sing&nbsp;<span class="markfdjlx0r6g SSBqA0O5vTLfa9GC1wxGQ" data-markjs=true>Happy Birthday</span> to me, so he improvised. Sorry you can’t hear it, but I’m still laughing&nbsp;😂.”</p><p>Biel continued, “Thank you, you wonderful human, for really listening to me, and for throwing my kinda party. And thank YOU ALL for the birthday wishes. Feeling the love.”</p><p>In the Limetown star’s Instagram Stories, she revealed that Timberlake and their 4-year-old son, Silas, surprised her with a specially cooked breakfast of scrambled eggs mixed with avocado and a side of bacon and doughnuts. “My boys know me SO well,” she wrote on Tuesday along with the pic. “Just came downstairs to this perfect birthday breakfast.”</p><p>The day before, Biel revealed that she kicked off her birthday celebrations early by chowing down on a gigantic slice of cake. “It’s a cake-bigger-than-my-face kind of (pre-)birthday…,” she <a href=#>captioned the pic</a> of her gasping while staring at the massive baked item on Monday, March 2.</p><p>Timberlake and Biel came together to honor the BoJack Horseman alum <a href=#>after a bumpy couple of months</a>. In November 2019, the “Sexyback” singer was photographed holding hands with <a href=#>his Palmer costar <strong>Alisha Wainwright</strong></a> during a night out in New Orleans with some of their colleagues. The viral images <a href=#>showed the pair holding hands beneath a table</a>, and the 30-year-old Raising Dion actress was even seen resting her hand on Timberlake’s knee.</p><p>After a source told Us Weekly that Timberlake and Wainwright were <a href=#>“just friends,”</a> the Friends With Benefits actor<a href=#> issued an apology</a> for his actions via Instagram on December 4. He noted that he “displayed a strong lapse of judgment,” but indicated that “nothing happened” with Wainwright. “I drank way too much that night and I regret my behavior,” he added.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In January, an insider told Us that <a href=#>Timberlake “is trying his hardest to prove himself” to Biel</a> after the scandal. “Justin knows exactly what Jessica wants to hear to relieve any stress,” the source revealed, noting that the pair are in therapy together. “They believe it’s constructive for their relationship.”</p><p>Scroll down to see photos from Biel’s birthday celebration.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkt7a%2F06KlZqyZoq%2Bmvsuaop5lpJ2%2FsMPSZqGeq6OesKJ5waKcpWWglreiucBmq6GdnZqxbq7Iq6uhnJGuerGt0a2waA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jos-luis-ram-rez.html><span>←</span><span>Jos Luis Ramrez</span></a>
