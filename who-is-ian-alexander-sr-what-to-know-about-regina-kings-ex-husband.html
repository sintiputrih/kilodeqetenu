The couple first met in the ’90s, and they welcomed their son Ian Alexander Jr. into the world on January 19, 1996. They were married the next year on April 23, 1997. The couple were together for 10 years before filing for divorce in 2007.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=333 data-current-count=673 data-injectable=true>Regina stated in the book He Never Came Home: Interviews, Stories, and Essays from Daughters on Life Without Their Fathers: “Just as I’d watched my parents arguing and fighting, my son watched his parents arguing and fighting. It was like history repeating itself, and I felt terrible about him having to witness that.”</p><h3 id=h-co-parenting data-injectable=false>Co-parenting</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Regina King (@iamreginaking)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=542 data-current-count=842 data-injectable=true>Ending a marriage is never easy. One day at a basketball game King noticed how estranged she and Ian Sr had become. She decided then and there to make a change for her son. She stated: “On an occasion when we should be united, we were miles apart, which was not cool. Because of our issues, Ian was becoming the kid whose parents were so disconnected that they couldn’t even sit next to each other, let alone have a civilized conversation.” That was a turning point for the exes who worked hard to be great co-parents to Ian Jr.</p><p data-characters=61 data-current-count=61 data-injectable=false>Ian Sr stayed out of public life since his divorce from King.</p><h3 id=h-tragedy data-injectable=false>Tragedy</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=361 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=670 data-injectable=true>In early 2022, the family announced that Ian Jr had died by suicide.
