Remini gained 80 pounds during her pregnancy and it was "concealed" with ponchos, laundry baskets, and a lot of baggy pajamas and sweatpants, along with a storyline that her usually fashionable character was unexpectedly unemployed.</p><p>On June 16, 2004, Remini and her husband, Angelo Pagan, welcomed daughter Sofia Bella Pagan. The baby, who weighed 6 pounds 5 ounces, arrived the day after Remini's own birthday, per <a href=#>The Chicago Tribune</a>.</p><p>Over the years, fans saw Sofia periodically pop up on TV. In 2008, Remini was trying to wean her then-toddler off of baby bottle, and viewers had a full view of the parenting problem. In a segment on <a href=#>"The Rachel Ray Show,"</a> cameras followed Remini for 24 hours as she tried to curb her defiant toddler's bottle use. And yes, that was a young Sofia cheering her mom from the audience when Remini competed&nbsp;on "Dancing with the Stars" in 2013. By 2014, the Pagan family starred in their own TLC reality show, <a href=#>"It's All Relative,"</a> which showed that the tween had inherited both of her parents' good looks.</p><p>&nbsp;But eight years later, Sofia is all grown up — and she's as much as a stunner as her famous mother.</p><h2>Leah Remini's daughter looked just like her in her prom photos</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/leah-reminis-daughter-is-her-twin/leah-reminis-daughter-looked-just-like-her-in-her-prom-photos-1677165731.jpg> <a href=#><span class=gallery-image-credit>Instagram</span></a><p>In May 2022, Leah Remini posted <a href=#>an Instagram photo</a> of her now-adult daughter, Sofia Pagan, on her prom night. The 18-year-old high school senior was dressed in an emerald green gown as she posed with her parents in front of a display of balloons that spelled out "PROM 2022." While the pic made it clear that Sofia is now all grown up, the side-by-side next to her mom also showed that Sofia shares more than just the star's long dark hair. Not only do the mom and daughter have similar facial features, but they posed with identical pouts for the milestone photo.</p><p>After Remini shared the special photo, fans couldn't help but notice much Sofia now looks like her mother. "Ya'll look identical. Both of you are beautiful," one fan <a href=#>wrote</a> to Remini in the comment section. "What a beautiful girl! I always thought over the years that she looked like your husband but, my goodness, she all you!" another <a href=#>added</a>. "Little mama twin there! Congrats!" another fan <a href=#>agreed</a>.</p><h2>Leah Remini sometimes wishes she could turn back time</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/leah-reminis-daughter-is-her-twin/leah-remini-sometimes-wishes-she-could-turn-back-time-1677165731.jpg> <span class=gallery-image-credit>DFree/Shutterstock</span><p>Leah Remini opened up about her daughter, Sofia Pagan, in a May 2021 interview on <a href=#>"The Drew Barrymore Show,"</a> where she revealed that the teen shares her love for hair and makeup. "She's a big fan of makeup, she buys tons of makeup, she hoards makeup, she doesn't necessarily wear a lot of makeup," Remini teased, before adding that her daughter also makes her aware of important social issues that she never thought of when she was a teenager. "I was thinking about Jordache and Sergio Valente... Candies shoes," Remini admitted of her own teen years.</p><p>But while she's super proud of the thoughtful young woman her daughter has grown into, Remini has admitted that she wishes she could stop the clock. In February 2023, Remini revealed that Sofia decided to switch colleges and would be heading to new school for her second semester. "You'd think the second time would be easier, but Angelo and I are even more of a mess now," the actor captioned an <a href=#>Instagram</a> post. She added that she was going through all of the same emotions she went through back in August when her only child left home for the first time. Remini also shared that she was spending a lot of time crying and looking at old family photos and videos — including old clips from "It's All Relative."&nbsp; "These videos from our reality show get me so emotional," Remini revealed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampgbX92fI6lnJqgXaeyrrXNoqpmnJGqtKnAxKtkoqtdnbKzedOwoKdn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lady-houdini-accident-kristen-johnson-injury.html><span>←</span><span>Lady Houdini Accident: Kristen Johnson Injury And Health At 2023</span></a>
