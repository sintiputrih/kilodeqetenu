He is probably best-known for horror and science fiction movies like “Halloween”, “Big Trouble in Little China”, “The Thing”, among many others.</p><p>Born in Carthage, New York, John Carpenter began making his own short horror films while in middle school. He attended USC Film School, but left early to work on his first feature film. During his second year at film school, he co-wrote, edited, and composed the score for the short film, “The Resurrection of Broncho Billy”. The film went on to win the Oscar for Best Live Action Short Film. He released his first film, “Dark Star” in 1974. The film’s high quality, which was achieved on a shoestring budget, caught Hollywood’s attention. His next film, “Assault on Precinct 13”, was a hit in Europe, but took longer to catch on in the US. His third film, “Halloween”, would finally establish him as a director/editor/composer of note. The film was made for $320,000 and grossed over $65 million at the box office. Throughout the late 70s and 80s, he wrote and directed a string of horror and thriller hits, including “Someone’s Watching Me”, “The Fog”, “Escape from New York”, “The Thing”, “Christine”, and “Starman”. He ran into problems after that, and has not been as commercially successful since then. His most recent release was “Ghost of Mars” in 2001 and “The Ward”, which screened at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2010.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fn7ypuoycmKuolaPBpr7SZqWerF2svLPAx2aZoqeXp66xtNhmnZqbpGKwor7EnqlmmaeWv6W%2FjJqlnWWcnrOmedKtpquxXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bob-odenkirk-guesting-on-the-bear-season-two-html.html><span>←</span><span>Bob Odenkirk Guesting on The Bear Season Two</span></a>
