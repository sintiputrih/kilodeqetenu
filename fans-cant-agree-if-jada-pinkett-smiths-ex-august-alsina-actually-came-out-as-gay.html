Many have offered their congratulations to the 30-year-old singer.

If Alsina was simply referring to platonic love then more power to him, but there’s no question that the video was edited to appear otherwise.&nbsp;If it was a ratings ploy, it’s understandable why fans — especially members and allies of the LGBTQ community — would be upset.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Gay or not.

He should be commended on that, and allowed the space to come forward with an explanation should he choose to do so.</p><p data-characters=137 data-current-count=137 data-injectable=false>Season eight of The Surreal Life has yet to be announced.
