<a href=../../how-many-generations-is-1-ethnicity.html></a>

As you can see, the case of 25% of a given ethnicity gives us exactly the number of generations that we'd expect. It's two generations ago, i.e. one of your four grandparents, who each gave you 25% of your DNA, on average. Obviously, an ancestor can't be a decimal number of generations away from you.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../page/2/>← Prev Page</a>
