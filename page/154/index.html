When you hear the word "Apple," you probably think of a either delicious fruit or a guy named Steve Jobs. Jobs' life story, of course, is one for the ages. A foster child who became a college dropout, according to Biography, his creative vision and funding proved instrumental in revolutionizing technologies such as the personal computer, MP3 players, cell phones, the animation industry (with Pixar), and more. His personal life was certainly messy and problematic, with a daughter he refused to recognize for years and a history of abusive behavior toward friends and employees, according to Business Insider, but there's no arguing the man's impact on culture, society, and the world.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Summer Kellsey Net Worth</h2><time>Feb 14, 2024</time>

<a href=../../the-google-pixel-xl-review.html></a>
System Performance Section by Brandon Chester
The Pixel XL's SoC is designed by&nbsp;Qualcomm and comes with four of its custom Kryo CPU cores‚Äîtwo with a peak frequency of 2.15GHz and two more that top out at&nbsp;1.59GHz. The quad-core CPU is paired with an&nbsp;Adreno 530 GPU. After hearing that, you may think that I'm describing Snapdragon 820, but in this case I'm actually describing Snapdragon 821. Qualcomm's SoCs often come in two versions with different sets of frequencies, and in the case of the Pixel XL Google has opted to use MSM8996 Pro-AB, which shares the same clock speeds as the normal MSM8996 that shipped in many of 2016's flagship smartphones.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../page/153/>‚Üê Prev Page</a>
