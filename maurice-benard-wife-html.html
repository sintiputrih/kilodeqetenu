He is also a&nbsp;spokesperson for the treatment of the disorder with Mental Health America.&nbsp;</p><p>Bernard lives in a family of six with&nbsp;his wife, Paula, and their four children in their California residence. The couple shares two daughters and a son who has already taken after his father to pursue acting.&nbsp;</p><h2>Maurice Bernard Felt the Bipolar Arc Was Too Long</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Going back to General Hospital, the series narrated a storyline where Bernard's character and his father both had bipolar disorder. Bernard admitted that the arc was especially emotional for him because of how much it resonated with his own life.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, things went on to the point that playing the part started becoming difficult for the actor because of how stretched out the arc was.&nbsp;</p><p>"Then my wife had to call&nbsp;General Hospital&nbsp;and say, 'Cut it,'" he explained.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>He also revealed that once when he was on the sets of the medical drama, he heard his mom and dad talking, when in fact, they weren't even there. That's when he decided that the arc needed to end.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>People Should Take Mental Health More Seriously</h2><p>But he admitted that the hallucinations weren't the worst&nbsp;part of having bipolar disorder.&nbsp;</p><p>"I think the worst part is either depression and maybe anxiety that happens," he explained, "and your mind can’t stop racing."&nbsp;</p><p>For a brief while, he also touched on how the stigma surrounding mental health had subdued, to a certain extent. However, he argued that despite the stigmatization going down, people were yet to take mental health as seriously as it should be taken.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Mental Health Issues Run in the Family</h2><p>The actor also expounded on how the mental disorder runs in the family because it was&nbsp;hereditary. It could be from either one's mother's or father's side of the family.&nbsp;</p><p>As for the actor, he suspected that he inherited the condition from his mother. Growing up. Bernard had his doubts, but his mother had never brought up the subject&nbsp;until sometime in 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>At the time, she agreed to visit a psychiatrist. Although the actor was not sure about her diagnosis, he was delighted by the fact that his mother told him that she didn't want to feel "this way" anymore.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKWRqr%2Bqr8RmmZ6mkaexbsPIn5xnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./matthew-rhys-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Matthew Rhys Net Worth 2024</span></a>
