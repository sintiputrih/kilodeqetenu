However, as fans would later find out, the glitzy exterior concealed some harrowing personal struggles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/did-jennette-mccurdy-have-a-relationship-with-her-dad-before-her-mom-died_.jpg><p>At just 11, McCurdy was already battling severe emotional issues brought about by her deeply dysfunctional relationship with her mom, Debra. “There was this half of my life that was so cheesy and so polished and so glossy and so fake,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she shared with The Washington Post in August 2022</a>.</p><p>“And then there was this other part of my life that was so painful and real and raw and hurting, and that part was going completely unseen.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ariana-grande-jennette-mccurdy-sam-and-cat.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Did Ariana Grande Make More Than Jennette McCurdy On 'Sam & Cat'?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Fans used to question whether Ariana Grande made more than Jennette McCurdy on 'Sam & Cat.'</span><p>The now 31-year-old's struggles went almost completely unnoticed by her father, Mark McCurdy, with whom she appears to have had a pretty strained relationship. Speaking to BuzzFeed in August 2022, Jennette delved into the complicated family dynamics that might’ve played a part in Mark deciding to turn a blind eye to her mom’s abusive tendencies.</p><p>“I get how complicated [my father’s] role in that family was,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she explained to BuzzFeed</a>. “My mom had this long affair, had these three other children that weren’t his, and I imagine the timing of her cancer played a factor in his sticking around. But, as much as I try to see it from the point of view of the various adults that were in the household, I just don’t have much respect for their approach.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-jennette-mccurdy-discover-that-mark-mccurdy-wasn-rsquo-t-her-biological-dad>How Did Jennette McCurdy Discover That Mark McCurdy Wasn’t Her Biological Dad?</h2><p>After losing her mom to a long-fought battle with cancer, McCurdy had to confront some shocking realities about her family, one of which was discovering that Mark McCurdy wasn’t her biological dad.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/jennette-mccurdy-signing-books.jpg><p>The shocking revelation, which surfaced during a poignant conversation with Mark, left Jennette feeling utterly adrift. “I remember feeling like I got the wind knocked out of me. My mouth was really dry,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she recalled of the conversation in her 2022 interview with Drew Barrymore</a>. “I felt that he’d always been pretty disengaged and disconnected. So, it was shocking, but I also started to find excuses for him in that information. Oh, that’s why he was so absent all those years."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Motivated almost entirely by guilt, Jennette attempted to revive her already strained relationship with Mark McCurdy.</p><p>“Initially, I felt a lot of guilt, and tried to really work on that relationship, and see him and his then I guess maybe she became his wife shortly after that. I tried to see them quite often, and then it just didn’t feel right in my bones,” she shared with Drew Barrymore. “I just felt like… there’s no real connection here, it just doesn’t feel right in my bones.”</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Miranda-Cosgrove-Jennette-McCurdy-iCarly.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>How Were Miranda Cosgrove And Jennette McCurdy Involved In The Dan Schneider Scandal?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Nickelodeon's reputation as one of the most trusted dynamos in history has rarely been challenged, until recently.</span><p>Ultimately, even Jennette's guilt wasn't enough to maintain the strained connection with Mark. “That was a relationship that I kind of let dissolve, let disintegrate,” she revealed to Drew Barrymore. “There wasn’t really much there to begin with.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-jennette-mccurdy-ever-find-her-biological-dad>Did Jennette McCurdy Ever Find Her Biological Dad?</h2><p>In the aftermath of the poignant conversation with Mark McCurdy, Jennette found herself embarking on a quest to find her biological father. Accompanied by her friend Colton and fellow iCarly luminary Miranda Cosgrove, Jennette set a course for a hotel in Newport Beach, where the man her mom had maintained an affair with for most of her marriage to Mark McCurdy was scheduled to perform.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/jennette-mccurdy-smiling.jpg><p>At the hotel, McCurdy finally came face to face with her biological dad. “I ask him if he knew about me, that I existed. He says yes. And my brothers,” she recalls in her memoir. “He says that he’s been waiting for us to contact him. He didn’t want to contact us because he wasn’t sure if we knew. He asks how I found out. I tell him. He says things ended poorly with Mom and that there was a big custody battle when we were little—that Mom said he was physically abusive (he assures me he wasn’t). She won.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though brief, the encounter ignited hope that Jennette might finally have the chance to build the happy family she’d craved for so long.</p><p>“My brothers, I have three older brothers, two of them are biological brothers, and they hadn’t met him, and I was sort of doing the thing of trying to get them to meet him,” she shared with Drew Barrymore, “and thinking like this could be good, this could be healing for all of us.”</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/The-Worst-Things-Jennette-McCurdys-Mom-Did-To-Her_-According-To-The-Star.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Does Jennette McCurdy Regret Revealing The Horrible Truth About Her Mother And Her Childhood Stardom?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Jennette McCurdy was incredibly honest in her memoir "I'm Glad My Mom Died, and since the book's release, she has spoken about how she feels about it.</span><p>For a time, it seemed quite likely that her newly discovered biological dad would fill the void left by the ever-aloof Mark McCurdy.</p><p>The two remained in close contact for several months after their first meeting, seeing each other “once a week” for “maybe three to four months,” before their bond ultimately disintegrated. “It got to a place where that one felt a little strange also,” Jennette explained to Barrymore.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdn7KvusStq55lnZiwtr7DsmSfoZ6ZeqO1zqWmoKGTlrlussCtn56qXaKus7eMppqcraKZxm7DwKylrWWYmr9usMCdZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./celebs-in-monique-lhuillier-dresses-regina-king-more.html><span>←</span><span>Celebs in Monique Lhuillier Dresses: Regina King, More</span></a>
