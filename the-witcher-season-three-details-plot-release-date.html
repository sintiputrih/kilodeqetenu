While the first five episodes will be premiering on June 29, the final three will be released on July 27.&nbsp;</p><p id=eLKr5k0Fqt data-wc=12><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>James Bond frontrunners: Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Henry Cavill and more – details</a></p><p id=enmRf94mpHg data-wc=13><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>The Witcher season 3 to make major change that fans will love</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/d50878c51233-geralt-the-witcher-season-three.jpg><h2 dir=ltr>The Witcher season three plot</h2><p id=e03u3k6_BGw data-wc=37>The official synopsis for season three explains: "As monarchs, mages, and beasts of the Continent compete to capture her, Geralt takes Ciri into hiding, determined to protect his newly-reunited family against those who threaten to destroy it."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/a8b1aca6e2c0-yennefer-the-witcher-season-three.jpg><p id=erDwyfm3WOD data-wc=57>Meanwhile, "Entrusted with Ciri's magical training, Yennefer leads them to the protected fortress of Aretuza, where they hope to uncover more about the girl's untapped powers; instead, they discover they've landed in a battlefield of political corruption, dark magic, and treachery. They must fight back, put everything on the line – or risk losing each other forever."</p><h2 dir=ltr>Why is Henry Cavill leaving The Witcher after season three?</h2><p id=eFLJ64YikZq data-wc=41>Back in October 2022, Henry Cavill revealed that he would be stepping down from the role of Geralt and handing the reins over to Liam Hemsworth. He had made the decision to leave The Witcher in order <a class=hm-link href=#>to return as Superman</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=ezYRMOCuYSE data-wc=63>Unfortunately, however, the actor later learned that DC Comics and Warner Bros had decided to recast the role. In an emotional Instagram post, Henry explained: "It's sad news, everyone. I will, after all, not be returning as Superman. After being told by the studio to announce my return back in October, prior to their hire, this news isn't the easiest, but that's life."&nbsp;</p><p id=eQN8LxOu_w5 data-wc=44>Following the news, Henry has since confirmed that he is working alongside his girlfriend and producer, Natalie Viscuso, to adapt the fantasy tabletop game Warhammer 40,000 for the screen. Recently, he also wrapped filming on Guy Ritchie's upcoming film,&nbsp;The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare.&nbsp;</p><p id=erk-xSj3R5 data-wc=23><strong>Like this story?<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Sign up to our What to Watch newsletter</a> and get the heads-up on the shows and films everyone’s talking about.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5tcGpraGt8tbTEZq6irJOdsrN50p6YrKeeYsGpvsSeZJ2dpJa2rb%2BMqaOorF2nsq2xwKycZpyRqbJw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-gabe-brown-gay-age-height-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Is Gabe Brown Gay?
