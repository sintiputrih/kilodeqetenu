Also to never take myself or people for granted and always be thankful and grateful to the people who helped me.”― Jackie Joyner-Kersee</p><p><strong>3rd of 52 Jackie Joyner-Kersee Quotes</strong></p><p>“It is better to look ahead and prepare than to look back and regret.”― Jackie Joyner-Kersee</p><p>“We live in a world where sports have the potential to bridge the gap between racism, sexism and discrimination. The 2012 Olympic Games was a great start but hopefully what these games taught us is that if women are given an opportunity on an equal playing field the possibilities for women are endless.”― <a href=#>Jackie Joyner-Kersee</a></p><p>“Winning is great, but being able to finish my last Olympic Games on American soil was very important. Even though I was injured, I didn’t let my psyche get the best of me and cause me to doubt myself, so I was willing to pull every muscle in my body in ’96 to get the job done and I came away with the bronze medal.”― Jackie Joyner-Kersee</p><p>“I would like ‘I Dream of Genie’ powers.”― Jackie Joyner-Kersee</p><p>“Once I leave this earth, I know I’ve done something that will continue to help others.”― Jackie Joyner-Kersee</p><p>“I’m not shy. I’m modest, but I’m very outgoing.”― <a href=#>Jackie Joyner-Kersee</a></p><p>“Your environment doesn’t define you. I don’t have a lot of money, but I can help train people and I can talk to people. We can all be mentors to the next generation.”― Jackie Joyner-Kersee</p><p>“I don’t think there is a perfect athlete. But if I had to come close to picking someone who demonstrates all the traits that I feel an athlete should have, I would say the perfect athlete would be Tiger Woods. He has the ability, he’s humble and he’s very good at what he does.”― Jackie Joyner-Kersee</p><p>“The London games mark the 24th anniversary of my winning two golds and setting the world record in the heptathlon. Someone is going to want it; records are made to be broken – it’s only a matter of time. I hope mine will outlive me.”― <a href=#>Jackie Joyner-Kersee</a></p><p>“It’s important to me to try and expose young people to the things they believe are off-limits to them. I tell them, ‘There are no walls, only the ones we put up.’ My advice to young people looking at my life is not to follow my footprint but to go out there and make their own.”― Jackie Joyner-Kersee</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Jackie-Joyner-Kersee-with-her-husband.jpg><p>“It’s better to look ahead and prepare, than to look back and regret.”― Jackie Joyner-Kersee</p><p>“Give back in some way.

It’s as if I’m keeping it all in a little bottle, and it’s all going to come out when I do the best I’m capable of doing.”― Jackie Joyner-Kersee</p><p>“Ask any athlete: We all hurt at times. I’m asking my body to go through seven different tasks. To ask it not to ache would be too much.”―<a href=#> Jackie Joyner-Kersee</a></p><p>“I don’t think being an athlete is unfeminine. I think of it as a kind of grace.”― Jackie Joyner-Kersee</p><p>“I learned to listen and listen very well. It helped me athletically and in the classroom as well. The person who talks a lot or talks over people misses out because they weren’t listening.”― Jackie Joyner-Kersee</p><p>“I set my sights on making an Olympic team, not realizing how tough it was going to be.”― Jackie Joyner-Kersee</p><p><strong>23rd of 52 Jackie Joyner-Kersee Quotes</strong></p><p>“I love track and field, but I also know the day will come when I will have to do something else.”― Jackie Joyner-Kersee</p><p>“Growing up in the time of Title IX – it was passed when I was 10 – I got a front-row seat to so many great moments in women’s sports.

It’s about being fit for life.”― Jackie Joyner-Kersee</p><p>“Even though I’m not a competitive athlete, I have to still maintain things and try to keep myself fit because I am at that age where I need to make sure to get those regular checkups and make sure everything is in tact.”― Jackie Joyner-Kersee</p><p>“There are many women who came before me who didn’t really have the same opportunities that I have had. That’s why I always wanted to be a great ambassador – not only today’s generation – but for the women who really didn’t have a voice, but who paved the way for me.”― Jackie Joyner-Kersee</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Jackie-Joyner-Kersee-quote-about-her-work.jpg><p>“I learned to listen and listen very well.

But for me, I try to keep everything in perspective and stay humble.”― Jackie Joyner-Kersee</p><p>“Some people are embarrassed to say they came from East St. Louis, Ill., but now more people want to claim it. I grew up in a community center and I knew what it gave me. I always knew I wanted to give back and help people because people helped me.”― Jackie Joyner-Kersee</p><p>“I’m a realist and I always have been. Quality training is what I do now; before it was a combination of both quality and quantity. Now I’m not trying to be a world-class athlete, I don’t need to train at that level. It’s about being fit, fit for life.”― Jackie Joyner-Kersee</p><p>“I’m more of a hands-on person. I like working with young people from the standpoint of providing support for the grassroots programs. State, national and Olympic champions begin at a grassroots level.”― <a href=#>Jackie Joyner-Kersee</a></p><p>“When I was in elementary school, we weren’t allowed to do sports other than cheerleading.

I remember seeing Evelyn Ashford in the 100 meters, and she was going to UCLA.”― Jackie Joyner-Kersee</p><p>“Competing in both track and field and basketball for the Bruins I have a lot of great memories to choose from. But my all-time favorite moment in collegiate sports has to be in 1982 when we won UCLA’s first NCAA title in track.”― Jackie Joyner-Kersee</p><p>“I was diagnosed with asthma when I was 18 during my freshman year at UCLA.

I witnessed women participating for the very first time, representing every nation.”― <a href=#>Jackie Joyner-Kersee</a></p><p>“My passion for giving is no different than yours.
