Her account is verified and most of her content relates to Taylor.</p><p>Swifties, however, are taking less and less of an interest in her. But it isn't because they're jealous of her or want to be her. It's because of how she acts.</p><p>In a TikTok where creator <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@taylorhamm93</a> claimed celebrity impersonators freaked her out, user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@itsjustashley13</a> stitched her grievances with Ashley in particular.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>"What really gets on my nerves is the whole going out in full Taylor Swift hair and makeup and then being annoyed that people are looking at her or mistaking her for Taylor," said @itsjustashley13.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>ashley leechin needs to be stopped i hope taylor calls her out or smth</p>— paris (@swiftwrecked) <a href=#>November 29, 2022</a></figure><p>She referred to a recent TikTok that Ashley posted in which she expressed how hard it was to constantly be mistaken for the songstress.</p><p>"How do you not lose yourself when everyone is constantly comparing you to a celebrity," she wrote in the video. But as @itsjustashley13 insinuated, it was hard to find sympathy for Ashley as she seems to be working extra hard to do everything she can to completely mimic the <a href=#>"Lavender Haze"</a> singer.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Users in the comments agreed.

They were not security all all, and instead were just paid actors. She purposely wanted everyone to think she was Taylor.</p><p>Naturally, fans flocked to her wanting to get photos and videos with who they believed was the real. Taylor</p><p>That same day, Ashley also went to another shopping area in Anaheim with her fake bodyguards to keep the act going. Once again, people were pining to get a photo with her.

If it were anyone else, it would have had a completely different outcome. This is why celebrities would hire decoys so they can enjoy their private event or quiey evening. Thank you to everyone who was so kind & sweet yesterday. Not going squash any other rumors because that is pointless. Just a friendly reminder, please do not bully any of my friends. You can bully me because it seems to be an okay thing to do in the ‘swiftie’ fandom but please do not bully my friends because they were incredible to work with. <a title=itsjustashley href=#>#itsjustashley</a> <a title=vicinthegame href=#>#vicinthegame</a> <a title=taylorswift href=#>#taylorswift</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Ashley" href=#>♬ original sound - Ashley</a></figure><p>In a TikTok video, Ashley referred to this whole incident as a "social experiment," claiming that she was trying to demonstrate how people are so celebrity-crazed.
