A transwoman, their name is… Sirona Ryan. Give yourself a few read-throughs of the name and see if you can spot any of the various issues.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Hogwarts Legacy introduces Sirona Ryan, the Harry Potter series' first trans character.<a href=#>#HogwartsLegacy</a> <a href=#>#HarryPotter</a> <a href=#>https://t.co/dHr0wnCCCw</a></p>— GameRevolution.com (@Game_Revolution) <a href=#>February 6, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=410 data-current-count=710 data-injectable=true>First of all, Sirona. While it’s a Celtic name which dates back centuries, you really wouldn’t want to give your transwoman a name which involves “sir.” Second of all is the second name being Ryan, which is fairly universally a masculine name. If you’re a tad more finnicky, you may have also noticed Sirona Ryan features “aryan”… which is an unfortunate choice.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Even a game that doesn’t have JKR on writing staff is still not free from giving their minority characters horribly tasteless names.

Within the culture wars this game has found itself, supporters of the game will likely end up complaining of it “going woke.” Meanwhile, those opposed to the game will continue to be so as a result of the name.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>This will change the mind of not one person who wasn't going to buy the game, transphobes on the other hand will be split between "omg game woke now" and "we're going to figure out how to kill her" so that's fun.</p>— TrueMetis (@TrueMetis) <a href=#>February 6, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=276 data-current-count=576 data-injectable=true>The classic jokes about Rowling’s failures to name minority characters were only further fueled by this, with the memes flowing in. Worth noting again is that Rowling has essentially nothing to do with the game’s writing, but will gain royalties from the release.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Sirona Ryan was the compromise after JK spent 17 uninterrupted hours arguing for ‘Amanda Stillaman’ <a href=#>https://t.co/zqb7Lp07jG</a></p>— Fancy Brenda 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️ (they/them) (@SpillerOfTea) <a href=#>February 6, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=206 data-current-count=506 data-injectable=true>Let’s have a moment of silence for the Celtic goddess Sirona, who may find herself stuck as a new and unfortunate mascot for the trans-exclusionary radical feminist crowd.
