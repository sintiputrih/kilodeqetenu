The universal language of text messaging includes vocabulary such as LOL (which can mean “Laugh Out Loud,” or “Lots of Love,” depending on whether you were born this century or last), WTF (“What The F**k”), and OMW (“On My Way!”), the latter of which Apple devices will do their utmost to correct, even if the term is nowhere close to resembling OMW.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=405 data-current-count=405 data-injectable=true>But WTD is a new one, only brought about in the last few years and recently seeing a surge in popularity, particularly as TikTok grows more relevant with each passing day. Even though it isn’t as current as it once was, Snapchat continues to be one of the most globally downloaded apps out there. We’d say it’s second only to TikTok, an entirely different kind of social media platform.</p><p data-characters=402 data-current-count=402 data-injectable=true>As we trek through the technological age, slang terms and abbreviations have become more common, particularly as texters get lazier with their replies. But it isn’t just laziness, many of us hard-working tax-payers just don’t have time to respond to paragraphs worth of text messages, so it’s easier to send across a few sentences or even a word or two that’s widely understood.</p><p data-characters=91 data-current-count=91 data-injectable=false>WTD is one such abbreviation that’s surfaced on Snapchat, but what does it stand for?</p><p data-characters=250 data-current-count=341 data-injectable=false>On Snapchat, TikTok, iMessage, and other platforms, WTD stands for “What’s The Deal?” as in “What’s happening?” or “What’s going on?” For example, someone might say “WTD with Rachel?”</p><p data-characters=257 data-current-count=598 data-injectable=true>Funnily enough, since F and D are so close together on the keyboard, one might accidentally send WTD instead of WTF, or vice-versa. Some users also understand WTD to be “What To Do” or in lower-case, it’s said to mean “wanted.”</p><p data-characters=114 data-current-count=114 data-injectable=false>And now, go forth with all your knowledge of slang and gossip with your loved ones to your heart’s content.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8uLTArWSdp5WoerjAw2aknpmeYryvedKnmKmbmJbBbsDIpKuoo12Wu6V5056vraGenHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./eva-mendes.html><span>←</span><span>The Symbolism Behind Wooden Maps: More Than Just Geography</span></a>
