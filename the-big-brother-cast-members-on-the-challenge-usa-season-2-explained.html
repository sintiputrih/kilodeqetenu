All in all, 24 reality television stars will compete for the title of champion, as well as a hefty grand prize check. The franchise’s longtime host, TJ Lavin, will also return for the second time as a frontman on CBS.</p><p data-characters=284 data-current-count=284 data-injectable=false>In this article, I’ll cover the nine contestants who will carry the Big Brother flag onto its reality competition show counterpart. As I go through them, I’ll note whether or not they’ve competed in The Challenge before — spoiler alert: the majority of them have.</p><p data-characters=15 data-current-count=299 data-injectable=false>So, here we go!</p><h2 id=h-faysal-shafaat-big-brother-20 data-injectable=false>Faysal Shafaat, Big Brother 20</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=599 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=312 data-current-count=312 data-injectable=false>Known better as “Fessy,” the towering Faysal Shafaat competed on Big Brother 20 and was regarded as the most physically imposing player of the season — and maybe ever. The Floridian was a member of the “FOUTTE” alliance, and he notched two Power of Veto wins and one Head of Household.</p><p data-characters=103 data-current-count=415 data-injectable=true>He was evicted after spending 72 days in the house: placing ninth and filling a spot as a jury member.</p><p data-characters=304 data-current-count=304 data-injectable=false>The former college football tight end is much more acquainted with The Challenge than Big Brother, however. Fessy has battled four times on The Challenge — season 35’s Total Madness, season 36’s Double Agents, season 37’s Spies, Lies & Allies, and season 38’s Ride or Dies.</p><p data-characters=237 data-current-count=541 data-injectable=true>Although consistently viewed as a threat, Faysal has yet to score a Challenge championship. He fell short in both Total Madness and Double Agents’ final challenges, and was eliminated before the finale in his latter two campaigns.</p><p data-characters=108 data-current-count=108 data-injectable=false>He also boasts a 5-1 elimination record, beating the likes of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jordan Wiseley</a> and Nelson Thomas in the sand.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Josh Martinez, Big Brother 19</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=408 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=371 data-injectable=false>Although a few runners-up are joining The Challenge: USA season 2 cast, Josh Martinez is the only Big Brother winner lending their personality in August. Josh is the king of Big Brother 19; he handed Paul Abrahamian his second-straight 5-4 defeat. Along with winning the final Head of House, Josh earned the top spot on two other occasions, as well as one Power of Veto.</p><p data-characters=102 data-current-count=473 data-injectable=true>However, Big Brother 19 wasn’t the last time reality fans saw Josh on their television screens.</p><p data-characters=183 data-current-count=183 data-injectable=false>A man known to wear his heart on his sleeve, Josh has spent a lot of time in The Challenge house and has earned a reputation — like on Big Brother — for his hot-headed arguments.</p><p data-characters=413 data-current-count=596 data-injectable=true>But, Josh hasn’t replicated the success he had on his first series. He’s been a contestant on five seasons of MTV’s The Challenge — season 33’s War of the Worlds, season 34’s War of the Worlds 2, Total Madness, Double Agents, and Spies, Lies & Allies — and has never made a final challenge. Unfortunately for Josh, he has a losing elimination record as well; it sits at 1-5.</p><p data-characters=191 data-current-count=191 data-injectable=false>Regardless, Josh knows how to make entertaining TV. And judging by the trailer, he looks in great shape. So, expect to see Josh do everything in his power to become a two-franchise champion.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Alyssa Snider, Big Brother 24</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=491 data-injectable=true>https://youtu.be/yGpMJroyYQU</figure><p data-characters=372 data-current-count=372 data-injectable=false>Representing the most recent season of Big Brother, 24’s Alyssa Snider is ready to do what she couldn’t the last time she competed on a reality show: win a competition. Alyssa didn’t have a flashy game, and she navigated her way through the house by staying under the radar with her social skills until she was evicted ahead of the final four on day 72.</p><p data-characters=168 data-current-count=540 data-injectable=true>She was unable to capture any Power of Vetos, and was never Head of House. But, she managed to survive the block once when she sat next to her showmance, Kyle Capener.</p><p data-characters=169 data-current-count=169 data-injectable=false>It’ll be interesting to see how she gels with the following two Big Brother players considering one of them was responsible for her being booted out of the house.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Ameerah Jones, Big Brother 24</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=469 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=320 data-current-count=320 data-injectable=false>Ameerah Jones had the shortest-lived Big Brother experience compared to the rest of the players on this list, but considering she had a grip on the house during season 24 and manufactured Pooch Pucciarelli’s blindside eviction, The Challenge: USA brass saw enough from the 32 year-old to invite her onto the show.</p><p data-characters=109 data-current-count=429 data-injectable=true>She was the second house guest taken out after receiving seven of 11 votes, and she left the game on day 17.</p><p data-characters=251 data-current-count=251 data-injectable=false>We never saw much of Ameerah’s competitive abilities due to her short stay in the house, although she showed herself as a political and social gamer, so it’ll be fun to see how Ameerah integrates herself with the other USA 2 cast members.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Monte Taylor, Big Brother 24</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=551 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=411 data-current-count=411 data-injectable=true>Monte Taylor will join Alyssa S and Ameerah as the third Big Brother 24 notable to crossover onto The Challenge. He also made it further than his ex-housemates; Monty placed as the runner-up on finale night behind Taylor Hale. A member of the season’s top alliance, “The Leftovers,” Monte scored three Head of Households — including during the final three — as well as two Power of Vetos.</p><p data-characters=444 data-current-count=444 data-injectable=true>As mentioned in Alyssa S’s section, the two have a history. It was during Monte’s Head of Household reign that Alyssa was nominated and ultimately evicted. Monte put the target squarely on her shoulders after sharing his worry that she was assembling an all-female alliance. After the vote, a 1-1 tie was announced and Monte was charged with breaking it. The rest was history; Monte voted out Alyssa S, dashing her $750,000 dream.</p><p data-characters=167 data-current-count=167 data-injectable=false>So, how will Monte and Alyssa S co-exist with each other on The Challenge: USA season 2, and will the latter be foaming at the mouth for revenge? Only time will tell.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Alyssa Lopez, Big Brother 23</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=467 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=317 data-current-count=317 data-injectable=false>Alyssa Lopez is one of three Challenge: USA season 1 contestants set to return for season 2. She’s also a Big Brother 23 alum; Alyssa L made it to day 65 before she was ousted during a double eviction by “The Cookout” alliance. Her seventh-place finish was bolstered by two Power of Veto victories.</p><p data-characters=256 data-current-count=573 data-injectable=true>A major high of Alyssa L’s time on USA 1 was when she and fellow Big Brother 23 star Kyland Young exacted vengeance against Xavier Prather, their original show’s winner, by tossing him into an elimination round that ultimately sent him packing.</p><p data-characters=248 data-current-count=248 data-injectable=false>Besides one daily challenge victory, Alyssa L also won an elimination round during episode 7 before being sent home right before the finale by Big Brother 20’s Angela Rummans via The Challenge’s staple game “Pole Wrestle.”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Tyler Crispen, Big Brother 20 & 22</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=548 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=327 data-current-count=327 data-injectable=false>Tyler Crispen, the popular, long-haired former lifeguard, is the only contestant this season to have played on two seasons of Big Brother. He debuted on CBS during Big Brother 20. Supported by his “Level Six” alliance (and three Head of Household and Power of Veto wins), Tyler made it all the way to finale night.</p><p data-characters=244 data-current-count=571 data-injectable=true>However, the jury chose to award Kaycee Clark the $500,000 grand prize over Tyler with a 5-4 vote. The sting was eased a bit; however, as he walked away with an extra $25,000 for being crowned “America’s Favorite Houseguest.”</p><p data-characters=258 data-current-count=258 data-injectable=false>He returned two seasons later to compete in Big Brother’s second rendition of “All-Stars.” His time in the house was not as impressive — but he still did well, placing sixth after winning two Head of Households and Power of Vetos apiece.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Paulie Calafiore, Big Brother 18</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=558 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=259 data-current-count=259 data-injectable=false>Making waves on season 18, Paulie Calafiore is the most old-school Big Brother player on USA 2. Paulie joined the CBS staple two seasons after his brother Cody placed second behind Derek Levasseur. Cody returned for Big Brother 22 and was crowned the victor.</p><p data-characters=380 data-current-count=639 data-injectable=true>Paulie’s time on Big Brother went entirely different, though. Although he performed well in competitions, which included snagging two Head of Households and three Power of Vetos, Paulie was taken out on day 65 in a unanimous vote. The eighth-place finish was just the start of his reality television career, however, with Paulie also a Challenge and Ex on the Beach veteran.</p><p data-characters=338 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>Season 32’s Final Reckoning was Paulie’s first taste of The Challenge, and he clawed his way to the final challenge before placing third. He also showed up on War of the Worlds where he fell just short of making it to the end. War of the Worlds 2 was his most recent season; he placed second alongside his Team USA teammates.</p><p data-characters=250 data-current-count=588 data-injectable=true>Paulie’s been dating Cara Maria Sorbello — a Challenge legend — for years, and he’s a polarizing figure in The Challenge community, meaning it’ll be fun to see how his Challenge and Big Brother counterparts react to his return.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Tiffany Mitchell, Big Brother 23</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=249 data-current-count=549 data-injectable=true>Tiffany Mitchell is the last ex-Big Brother houseguest on this list, as well as the final one who has experience competing in The Challenge. She’ll join Alyssa L as a Big Brother 23 star looking to bounce back from her USA 1 defeat last year.</p><p data-characters=435 data-current-count=435 data-injectable=true>Tiffany is credited for creating “The Cookout,” the dominant alliance on Big Brother 23, and she also won “America’s Favorite Houseguest,” a payday netting her a crisp $50,000. She became the Head of Household twice — although her first stint ended prematurely due to a twist — and was evicted a week after Alyssa L. Her sixth place finish was a better feat than her Challenge accomplishment, however.</p><p data-characters=111 data-current-count=111 data-injectable=false>She was eliminated in the second episode. Regardless, Tiffany is back and ready to battle her way to the top.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMRmmaKfXZe%2FsMDHnqlmm5GowW65xKaZnqqjYryvedOhnGabmJa5rbHNoJxmraOWerSxwKymp2ViYrK5vMuaoKedlGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./noel-fielding-rare-post-daughter-iggy-takes-photo.html><span>←</span><span>Noel Fielding shares rare post about eldest daughter Dali delighted fans react</span></a>
