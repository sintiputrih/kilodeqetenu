That certainly was Ashley Greene's experience by the time of the final "Twilight" film's release. In a November 2012 Marie Claire profile, Greene lamented the disruption of personal relationships after the vampire blockbusters made her a household name. "It was a hard adjustment going from zero to 100 in a day. But it was also hard to talk to [friends], because you don't want to be a jerk," she confessed (via <a href=#>Page Six</a>).&nbsp;Some within Greene's inner circle reportedly couldn't help but perceive her differently after her overnight fame.&nbsp;"After the movie came out, some people said, 'You changed.' And I said, 'I haven't changed, dude. Your opinion of me has changed because I am working on this film,'" she shared, reassuring that her parents let her know if fame had gone to her noggin.</p><p>Another unforeseen struggle for&nbsp;the "LOL" star was dating within her industry. Dubbing the experience of dating fellow actors as brief, Greene&nbsp;broke it down in the same 2012 Marie Claire interview. "You go on a couple of dates, and then someone ships off to do a movie," she explained. "It's not like you're going to fly out and see them, because it's not serious enough for that."&nbsp;</p><p>However, dating and keeping old friends weren't the deepest issues Greene has had to face since her "Twilight" fame.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxoZX1zf46sq6utl5y5pr%2BMmqqhpJWueqi%2BxJ6lnmWWlrCmsIybnJ%2Bnopp6qa3LpaSaqptisKmtzaecpWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mickey-drexler-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Mickey Drexler Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</span></a>
