Sui generis. Following his comedy special titled <a href=#>My Favorite Shapes</a> and co-creating and starring in an HBO series about a Latin American group of reverse-Scooby-Doo-ers called <a href=#>Los Espookys</a>, his upcoming debut film, Problemista, looks to be just as surreal and funny as … everything else he makes. He stars as Alejandro, an artist who lives in the U.S. and has one month to find a cosigner on his visa, so he attempts to get his boss, played by Tilda Swinton, to be that cosigner. The film was originally scheduled for an August 4 debut but was postponed indefinitely due to the strike. On January 18, A24 put out a promo video featuring Torres getting a call from Swinton on his shellphone and revealing to both her and us that the film will finally premiere in theaters March 1. Then, Torres gets a Grindr message and screenshots it, because his priorities are in check.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clrjbhfwm000c3b81sk8q726x@published data-word-count=124>While the <a href=#>first trailer</a> for the film leaned heavily on the surreal, the second (above) gives us a comparatively grounded look at the movie. There’s still a literal hourglass turned over to symbolize the amount of time Alejandro has before he gets kicked out of the country (we said “comparatively”). We also get a look at how desperate for cash Alejandro is (-$407.43 in his bank account) and how little his boss knows about El Salvador (pupusas and nuns). Other than Torres and Swinton, the A24 film stars RZA, Greta Lee, Larry Owens, Catalina Saavedra, and Isabella Rossellini as the narrator. While we’re disappointed the movie isn’t already out as was originally planned, there is something to the smell of surrealism in the spring.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clrjchfwb000i3b702oxfspn8@published data-word-count=5>This post has been updated.</p><h3 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h3><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clf9wbqxu00000hcsn5ba5sfl@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Problemista Is So Very Julio Torres</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clcarermr00160oeiujbj0xgb@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Los Espookys Was a Blessing</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clbazak01000046dvz06vyxxk@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Tilda Swinton Loves to Play With Bong Joon Ho</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Julio Torres Is Facing Flamboyant and Clerical Dangers</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57wKuropucmnyrwcuipmasn6e%2Fpr%2BMqamompyauqq%2F05pkraqRnrmmvoycmKysXaeyrbHArJxmnJGpsm%2B006aj</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jimmy-lewis.html><span>←</span><span>Jimmy Lewis Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</span></a>
