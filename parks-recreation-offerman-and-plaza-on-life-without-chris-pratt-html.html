Working here is the most delicious security blanket combined with an ice-cream cone, but without Pratt there’s like a little bit of cumulonimbus cloud blocking the sun.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d8cc663567a42dd1df27e0f0fe179f18-5-0-0@published data-word-count=75><span>Rest assured, you’ll see plenty of Andy — only thinner, blonder, more Star Lord–like — in tonight’s joyful one-hour season premiere. The gang goes to London (making it easy for Pratt to join them) to accompany Leslie while she accepts an award from the International Women in Government organization. There, Andy meets a kindred spirit (played by guest star Peter Serafinowicz), which will explain why he won’t be in Pawnee for a bunch of episodes.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d8cc663567a42dd1df27e0f0fe179f18-6-0-0@published data-word-count=70>Aubrey Plaza said Pratt has only been back once since they shot the premiere over the summer. “We’re filming episode six or seven already and he hasn’t been here. He’s been gone and it sucks. Everyone misses him. He’s like this beacon of happiness whenever he’s around.” She hasn’t been coping well. “I’m trying to fill his shoes, but it’s really hard because I usually have a really bad attitude.”</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Offerman and Plaza on Life Without Chris Pratt</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlobGdgbnyxrdGkqmaqlZi%2Fpq3ToqanZZ%2Bbs6a%2BzJqlZpmemXqxuMCzmGannmK5qrLEZq6irJikwrV5wqGpoqtdpb%2BiwNNnn62lnA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./781651-jim-carrey-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Jim Carrey Net Worth 2024: What Is The Comedy Legend Worth?</span></a>
